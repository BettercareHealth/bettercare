# Test 2: Assessment of fetal growth and condition during pregnancy

1.	What is normal fetal growth?
	-	Will be present if a patient gains weight during pregnancy.
	+	The fetal weight is within the expected range of the duration of the pregnancy.
	-	Can only be accurately assessed by regular ultrasound assessment.
	-	Will be present if the amount of liquor is normal.
2.	Which of the following maternal factors can cause intra-uterine growth restriction?
	-	Tobacco smoking.
	-	Alcohol intake.
	-	Pre-eclampsia.
	+	All of the above.
3.	Which of the following statements about intra-uterine growth restriction is correct?
	-	The cause of severe intra-uterine growth restriction is usually unknown.
	+	Both maternal and fetal factors may cause intra-uterine growth restriction.
	-	Primary placental insufficiency is a common cause of intra-uterine growth restriction.
	-	Poor maternal weight gain during pregnancy is of great value in the diagnosis of intra-uterine growth restriction.
4.	Which of the following is the best clinical method of determining uterine growth between 18 and 36 weeks of pregnancy?
	-	An abdominal examination.
	+	The distance in centimetres between the upper edge of the symphysis pubis and the fundus of the uterus.
	-	Recording the fetal heart rate at each antenatal visit.
	-	The abdominal circumference measured with a tape at each antenatal visit.
5.	The ability to detect abnormalities in symphysis-fundus growth is improved if:
	-	More persons are involved in assessing patients at antenatal visits.
	-	Patients are also weighed at each antenatal visit.
	+	The same person sees the patient at every antenatal visit.
	-	Ultrasound examinations are done at every second visit.
6.	Which of the following symphysis-fundus height measurements is used to screen for intra-uterine growth restriction?
	-	A slowing of the symphysis-fundus growth until two measurements are below the 10th centile.
	+	A slowing of the symphysis-fundus growth until one measurement is below the 10th centile.
	-	Two measurements the same irrespective of their positions on the centile lines.
	-	A measurement that is less than that recorded two visits before and falls below the 10th centile.
7.	With severe intra-uterine growth restriction, the difference between the gestational age and the symphysis-fundus height measurement is:
	-	2 weeks or more.
	-	3 weeks or more.
	+	4 weeks or more.
	-	5 weeks or more.
8.	Does descent of the presenting part affect your interpretation of the symphysis-fundus growth?
	+	Yes, after 36 weeks with progressively less fetal head palpable above the pelvic inlet the criteria to diagnose intra-uterine restriction will no longer be valid.
	-	No, the curve is designed to take descent of the presenting part into account.
	-	No, as it is no longer necessary to palpate the amount of fetal head palpable above the pelvic inlet once it has been established that it is not a breech presentation at 34 weeks.
	-	No, as palpation of the amount of fetal head above the pelvic inlet is inaccurate.
9.	What action is required if the symphysis-fundus height measurement at a gestational age of 30 weeks suggests intra-uterine growth restriction?
	-	Patients who smoke should stop smoking.
	-	Give advice about a high-energy diet and if necessary food parcels.
	-	Careful attention must be given to counting fetal movements.
	+	All of the above.
10.	If the symphysis-fundus measurement suggests intra-uterine growth restriction at 32 weeks gestation, what is the correct management?
	-	A vaginal examination must be done to determine whether the patient’s cervix is favourable for an induction.
	-	The patient must return to the antenatal clinic at 36 weeks.
	-	Fetal heart rate monitoring must be done at each antenatal visit.
	+	The patient must be transferred to a level 2 hospital for a Doppler umbilical artery blood flow measurement.
11.	What should be done if measures to improve symphysis-fundus growth were unsuccessful?
	-	Nothing as the fetus is small but healthy.
	+	With moderate intra-uterine growth restriction and good fetal movements delivery at 38 weeks should be considered.
	-	The patient can continue to smoke and no further action is required.
	-	Pre-eclampsia can be excluded as intra-uterine growth restriction and pre-eclampsia never occur together.
12.	The fetal condition can best be determined during the antenatal period by:
	-	Weighing the patient at every antenatal visit.
	-	Measuring the patient’s blood pressure.
	-	Counting the fetal heart rate.
	+	Counting fetal movements.
13.	During the antenatal period it is essential to determine the fetal condition from:
	-	36 weeks.
	-	34 weeks.
	+	28 weeks.
	-	24 weeks.
14.	Which of the following statements about fetal movements is correct?
	-	The date when fetal movements are first felt is a good indication of the gestational age.
	-	Good fetal movements do not necessarily indicate fetal wellbeing.
	+	All patients should be told about the importance of fetal movements.
	-	A decrease in fetal movements always indicates that the fetus is distressed.
15.	Which patients should use a fetal movement chart?
	+	All patients where there is reason to be worried about the fetal condition.
	-	All primigravidas.
	-	All pregnant patients from 28 weeks gestation.
	-	All patients who have had a previous Caesarean section.
16.	When during the day would you advise a patient to count fetal movements?
	+	Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day after breakfast.
	-	Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day before breakfast.
	-	Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day after lunch.
	-	Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day after supper.
17.	How would you advise a patient to count fetal movements?
	-	She should preferably do it together with other work as physical activity stimulates the fetus to move.
	+	She should preferably do it while resting on her side.
	-	She should preferably do it while lying flat on her back.
	-	While commuting to work in a taxi.
18.	When will you be worried that a patient may have a decreased number of fetal movements?
	-	15–20 movements per hour.
	-	10–15 movements per hour.
	-	5–10 movements per hour.
	+	Half as many fetal movements as previously counted.
19.	What would you advise if a patient felt only a few fetal movements during an hour?
	-	The patient must go to her nearest clinic immediately and report that her fetus is only moving a little.
	+	The patient should lie on her side for a further hour and count the fetal movements.
	-	The patient should repeat the fetal movement count in the afternoon.
	-	Antenatal fetal heart rate monitoring is indicated and, therefore, she must report to her nearest hospital.
20.	What management would be correct if a patient with reduced fetal movements presents at a hospital that does not have a cardiotocograph (CTG machine)?
	-	The responsible doctor must see the patient immediately as a Caesarean section should be done.
	-	Refer the patient urgently to a hospital that has a cardiotocograph.
	+	Exclude the possibility of fetal death by listening for the fetal heart with a stethoscope.
	-	Fetal movements must be counted again the next day.
