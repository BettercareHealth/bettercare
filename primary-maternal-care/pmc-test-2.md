# Test 2: Assessment of fetal growth and condition during pregnancy

1.	What is normal fetal growth?
	1.	Will be present if a patient gains weight during pregnancy.
	1.	The fetal weight is within the expected range of the duration of the pregnancy.
	1.	Can only be accurately assessed by regular ultrasound assessment.
	1.	Will be present if the amount of liquor is normal.
2.	Which of the following maternal factors can cause intra-uterine growth restriction?
	1.	Tobacco smoking.
	1.	Alcohol intake.
	1.	Pre-eclampsia.
	1.	All of the above.
3.	Which of the following statements about intra-uterine growth restriction is correct?
	1.	The cause of severe intra-uterine growth restriction is usually unknown.
	1.	Both maternal and fetal factors may cause intra-uterine growth restriction.
	1.	Primary placental insufficiency is a common cause of intra-uterine growth restriction.
	1.	Poor maternal weight gain during pregnancy is of great value in the diagnosis of intra-uterine growth restriction.
4.	Which of the following is the best clinical method of determining uterine growth between 18 and 36 weeks of pregnancy?
	1.	An abdominal examination.
	1.	The distance in centimetres between the upper edge of the symphsyis pubis and the fundus of the uterus.
	1.	Recording the fetal heart rate at each antenatal visit.
	1.	The abdominal circumference measured with a tape at each antenatal visit.
5.	The ability to detect abnormalities in symphysis-fundus growth is improved if:
	1.	More persons are involved in assessing patients at antenatal visits.
	1.	Patients are also weighed at each antenatal visit.
	1.	The same person sees the patient at every antenatal visit.
	1.	Ultrasound examinations are done at every second visit.
6.	Which of the following symphysis-fundus height measurements is used to screen for intra-uterine growth restriction?
	1.	A slowing of the symphysis-fundus growth until two measurements are below the 10th centile.
	1.	A slowing of the symphysis-fundus growth until one measurement is below the 10th centile.
	1.	Two measurements the same irrespective of their positions on the centile lines.
	1.	A measurement that is less than that recorded two visits before and falls below the 10th centile.
7.	With severe intra-uterine growth restriction, the difference between the gestational age and the symphysis-fundus height measurement is:
	1.	2 weeks or more.
	1.	3 weeks or more.
	1.	4 weeks or more.
	1.	5 weeks or more.
8.	Does descent of the presenting part affect your interpretation of the symphysis-fundus growth?
	1.	Yes, after 36 weeks with progressively less fetal head palpable above the pelvic inlet the criteria to diagnose intra-uterine restriction will no longer be valid.
	1.	No, the curve is designed to take descent of the presenting part into account.
	1.	No, as it is no longer necessary to palpate the amount of fetal head palpable above the pelvic inlet once it has been established that it is not a breech presentation at 34 weeks.
	1.	No, as palpation of the amount of fetal head above the pelvic inlet is inaccurate.
9.	What action is required if the symphysis-fundus height measurement at a gestational age of 30 weeks suggests intra-uterine growth restriction?
	1.	Patients who smoke should stop smoking.
	1.	Give advice about a high-energy diet and if necessary food parcels.
	1.	Careful attention must be given to counting fetal movements.
	1.	All of the above.
10.	If the symphysis-fundus measurement suggests intra-uterine growth restriction at 32 weeks gestation, what is the correct management?
	1.	A vaginal examination must be done to determine whether the patient’s cervix is favourable for an induction.
	1.	The patient must return to the antenatal clinic at 36 weeks.
	1.	Fetal heart rate monitoring must be done at each antenatal visit.
	1.	The patient must be transferred to a level 2 hospital for a Doppler umbilical artery blood flow measurement.
11.	What should be done if measures to improve symphysis-fundus growth were unsuccessful?
	1.	Nothing as the fetus is small but healthy.
	1.	With moderate intra-uterine growth restriction and good fetal movements delivery at 38 weeks should be considered.
	1.	The patient can continue to smoke and no further action is required.
	1.	Pre-eclampsia can be excluded as intra-uterine growth restriction and pre-eclampsia never occur together.
12.	The fetal condition can best be determined during the antenatal period by:
	1.	Weighing the patient at every antenatal visit.
	1.	Measuring the patient’s blood pressure.
	1.	Counting the fetal heart rate.
	1.	Counting fetal movements.
13.	During the antenatal period it is essential to determine the fetal condition from:
	1.	36 weeks.
	1.	34 weeks.
	1.	28 weeks.
	1.	24 weeks.
14.	Which of the following statements about fetal movements is correct?
	1.	The date when fetal movements are first felt is a good indication of the gestational age.
	1.	Good fetal movements do not necessarily indicate fetal wellbeing.
	1.	All patients should be told about the importance of fetal movements.
	1.	A decrease in fetal movements always indicates that the fetus is distressed.
15.	Which patients should use a fetal movement chart?
	1.	All patients where there is reason to be worried about the fetal condition.
	1.	All primigravidas.
	1.	All pregnant patients from 28 weeks gestation.
	1.	All patients who have had a previous caesarean section.
16.	When during the day would you advise a patient to count fetal movements?
	1.	Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day after breakfast.
	1.	Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day before breakfast.
	1.	Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day after lunch.
	1.	Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day after supper.
17.	How would you advise a patient to count fetal movements?
	1.	She should preferably do it together with other work as physical activity stimulates the fetus to move.
	1.	She should preferably do it while resting on her side.
	1.	She should preferably do it while lying flat on her back.
	1.	While commuting to work in a taxi.
18.	When will you be worried that a patient may have a decreased number of fetal movements?
	1.	15–20 movements per hour.
	1.	10–15 movements per hour.
	1.	5–10 movements per hour.
	1.	Half as many fetal movements as previously counted.
19.	What would you advise if a patient felt only a few fetal movements during an hour?
	1.	The patient must go to her nearest clinic immediately and report that her fetus is only moving a little.
	1.	The patient should lie on her side for a further hour and count the fetal movements.
	1.	The patient should repeat the fetal movement count in the afternoon.
	1.	Antenatal fetal heart rate monitoring is indicated and, therefore, she must report to her nearest hospital.
20.	What management would be correct if a patient with reduced fetal movements presents at a hospital that does not have a cardiotocograph (CTG machine)?
	1.	The responsible doctor must see the patient immediately as a caesarean section should be done.
	1.	Refer the patient urgently to a hospital that has a cardiotocograph.
	1.	Exclude the possibility of fetal death by listening for the fetal heart with a stethoscope.
	1.	Fetal movements must be counted again the next day.
