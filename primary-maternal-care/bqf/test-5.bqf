title: Primary Maternal Care. Test 5. Preterm labour and preterm rupture of the membranes

What is the definition of preterm labour?
-	Labour starting one hour or more after rupture of the membranes.
-	Labour starting before 40 weeks of gestation.
+	Labour starting before 37 weeks of gestation.
-	Labour starting when the fetus is assessed as weighing less than 2000 g, when the gestational age is unknown.

Preterm rupture of the membranes is defined as:
-	Membranes that have ruptured at term, and not been followed by the onset of labour within 24 hours.
-	Membranes that rupture before the second stage of labour.
+	Membranes that have ruptured before 37 weeks of gestation, in the absence of contractions.
-	Membranes that have ruptured before the onset of labour at any gestational age.

Preterm labour is important because it commonly results in death of the infant due to:
-	Abruptio placentae.
-	Birth trauma.
-	Jaundice.
+	Hyaline membrane disease.

Chorioamnionitis is usually caused by:
-	Bacteria which cross the placenta from the maternal circulation to the fetus.
+	Bacteria which spread from the cervix and vagina.
-	Viral infection of the genitalia.
-	Candida vaginitis.

Choose the correct statement regarding chorioamnionitis:
-	It causes all cases of preterm labour.
-	It always follows preterm rupture of the membranes.
+	It may cause and complicate preterm rupture of the membranes.
-	It only occurs in patients with vaginitis.

Subclinical chorioamnionitis usually results in:
+	No signs or symptoms in the mother or fetus.
-	Maternal pyrexia and tachycardia.
-	An offensive vaginal discharge.
-	Abdominal tenderness.

Clinical chorioamnionitis may present with:
-	Headache and backache.
-	Vaginal bleeding.
+	Fetal tachycardia.
-	Dysuria and frequency.

Antibiotics should be given to:
-	All patients with preterm rupture of the membranes.
-	All infants with preterm labour.
+	Patients with clinical signs of chorioamnionitis.
-	Patients with ruptured membranes, where the pregnancy is allowed to continue.

Which of the following commonly causes preterm labour?
+	Multiple pregnancy.
-	Excessive weight gain during pregnancy.
-	A breech presentation.
-	No sexual intercourse in the second half of pregnancy.

Which patients are at the highest risk of preterm labour?
-	Patients who book early in pregnancy.
-	Multigravidas.
+	Patients with a history of preterm labour in a previous pregnancy.
-	Patients living in low socio-economic circumstances.

Women at increased risk of preterm labour should:
-	Increase their normal amount of exercise.
-	Not take baths.
-	Not be examined vaginally at the antenatal clinics.
+	Avoid coitus during the second half of their pregnancies.

Braxton Hicks contractions:
+	Are sometimes uncomfortable but are not painful.
-	Are regular.
-	Are associated with cervical dilatation.
-	Increase in duration and frequency.

Preterm labour is present when:
-	A patient experiences painful contractions prior to 37 weeks.
-	Regular uterine contractions, palpable on abdominal examination prior to 37 weeks is present.
+	Regular uterine contractions, palpable on abdominal examination and cervical effacement and/or dilatation on vaginal examination prior to 37 weeks.
-	A patient has a history of rupture of the membranes prior to 37 weeks irrespective of whether or not she has uterine contractions.

Patients with preterm rupture of the membranes should have:
-	A digital vaginal examination to assess the state of the cervix.
+	A sterile speculum examination only.
-	No vaginal examination at all.
-	Only a rectal examination.

The pH of amniotic fluid is:
-	Acid.
-	Neutral.
+	Alkaline.
-	Variable.

How should a patient with preterm labour at a gestational age of 36 weeks be managed?
+	The patient should be delivered in a MOU or district hospital.
-	The patient should be delivered in a level 1 facility.
-	The patient should be referred to a level 2 facility for delivery.
-	Preterm labour should be suppressed and the patient transferred to a level 1 facility for further suppression of preterm labour.

What should be done if preterm labour has been diagnosed at a primary care antenatal clinic and the patient is less than 34 weeks pregnant?
+	Contractions need to be suppressed and the patient referred urgently to a level 2 hospital.
-	Contractions need to be suppressed and the patient referred urgently to a level 1 hospital.
-	There is no time to suppress contractions as this will only delay the urgent transfer of the patient.
-	If the cervix is less than 2 cm dilated it is better to wait to see if further dilatation occurs before transfer is arranged.

How would you decide that a patient is less than 34 weeks pregnant if the duration of the pregnancy is unknown?
-	The estimated fetal weight will be less than 2500 g and the syphysis-fundus measurement will be less than 34 cm.
+	The estimated fetal weight will be less than 2000 g and the syphysis-fundus measurement will be less than 33 cm.
-	If in doubt the patient should be referred to a level 2 hospital to be evaluated.
-	An ultrasound examination needs to be done urgently to establish the correct gestational age.

Salbutamol (Ventolin) should not be used in a patient with:
-	Asthma.
-	Preterm rupture of the membranes.
-	Multiple pregnancy.
+	Heart valve disease.

What advice should be given to a patient who had a preterm delivery?
-	If she only had one previous preterm delivery, there is no need to be concerned about future pregnancies.
-	There is a high risk of recurrence, it will be better not to attempt future pregnancies.
-	Intervention is only required if a patient had two previous preterm deliveries.
+	The patient should be seen at a level 2 hospital before her next pregnancy to be assessed for possible causes.
