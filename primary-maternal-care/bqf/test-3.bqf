What is the definition of hypertension in pregnancy?
-	A diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or above and/or a systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg or above
+	A diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or above and/or a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or above
-	A diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or above and/or a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or above
-	A rise in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg.

What is the definition of significant proteinuria in pregnancy?
-	A trace of protein
+	1+ protein or more
-	2+ protein or more
-	3+ protein

How should you define pre-eclampsia?
-	Hypertension and proteinuria presenting before the start of pregnancy
-	Hypertension and proteinuria presenting in the first half of pregnancy
+	Hypertension and proteinuria presenting in the second half of pregnancy
-	Hypertension and proteinuria presenting any time in pregnancy

What is the correct definition of chronic hypertension?
+	Hypertension, without proteinuria, that is present in the first half of pregnancy
-	Hypertension, together with proteinuria, that is present in the first half of pregnancy
-	Hypertension that is present in the first half of pregnancy, plus proteinuria that presents in the second half of pregnancy
-	Hypertension alone which is present at the time of booking at 28 weeks

How common is pre-eclampsia?
-	Most pregnant women develop pre-eclampsia.
-	About 25% of all pregnant women develop pre-eclampsia.
+	About 5–6% of all pregnant women develop pre-eclampsia
-	Very rare

Which fetal condition is common in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia?
-	Congenital malformations
-	Heart failure due to hypertension
-	Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn
+	Intra-uterine growth restriction

Pre-eclampsia may cause fetal distress because it results in:
+	A decrease in placental blood flow
-	Fetal hypertension
-	Severe protein loss in the mother’s urine
-	Congenital abnormalities caused by antihypertensive drugs

A patient with pre-eclampsia who develops a diastolic blood pressure of 105 mm Hg and 2+ proteinuria at 36 weeks of pregnancy should be graded as having:
+	Pre-eclampsia
-	Severe pre-eclampsia
-	Imminent eclampsia
-	Eclampsia

What is an important sign of imminent eclampsia?
-	3 + proteinuria
+	Increased tendon reflexes
-	A diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or more
-	Tenderness on palpating the calves

A patient with pre-eclampsia has a diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg and 1+ proteinuria. She complains of flashes of light in front of her eyes and upper abdominal pain. In which of the following grades of pre-eclampsia should you put this patient?
-	Pre-eclampsia
-	Severe pre-eclampsia
+	Imminent eclampsia
-	Eclampsia

Which of the following women has the highest risk of pre-eclampsia?
+	A patient with a history of pre-eclampsia starting early in the third trimester of a previous pregnancy
-	A patient with a history of a preterm delivery in her previous pregnancy
-	Grande multiparas
-	A patient who previously had a twin pregnancy

Which one of the following may be an early warning sign of pre-eclampsia? 
-	Weight loss during the last months of pregnancy
+	Generalised oedema especially of the face
-	Oedema of the feet at the end of the day
-	Pain on passing urine

What is the management of a patient with pre-eclampsia ?
-	Oral antihypertensive drugs
-	Diuretics to reduce oedema
+	Hospitalisation
-	A loading dose of magnesium sulphate

Which one of the following is the method of delivery usually chosen in a patient with pre-eclampsia?
-	Caesarean section
-	Surgical induction followed by vaginal delivery at 34 weeks
+	Surgical induction followed by vaginal delivery if 36 weeks gestation has been reached.
-	Waiting until 42 weeks for a spontaneous onset of labour.

What is an important complication of pre-eclampsia?
-	Placenta praevia
-	Oedema of the face
-	Glycosuria
+	Intracerebral haemorrhage

Which of the following is the correct method of treatment for a patient with severe pre-eclampsia?
+	The patient should be stabilised first, then be moved to a level 2 hospital for further management.
-	The patient should immediately be rushed to the nearest level 3 hospital for stabilisation.
-	The patient should be managed at a level 1 hospital.
-	The infant must immediately be delivered by Caesarean section at a level 2 hospital.

What drug is used to manage a diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or more?
-	Alpha-methyldopa (Aldomet)
+	Nifedipine (Adalat)
-	Diazepam (Valium)
-	Propranolol (Inderal)

What is an important sign of magnesium sulphate overdosage?
-	Vomiting
-	Hyperventilation
-	A urine output of less than 20 ml per hour
+	Depressed tendon reflexes

What drug is used to prevent and manage eclampsia?
+	Magnesium sulphate
-	Magnesium trisilicate
-	Alpha-methyldopa (Aldomet)
-	Diazepam (Valium)

How should a patient, who feels well but has a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg at 36 weeks gestation, be managed? At all her previous antenatal visits, her blood pressure was normal, and she has no proteinuria.
-	She must be given an intramuscular injection of dihydralazine (Nepresol).
-	She must be hospitalised.
+	Alpha methyl dopa (Aldomed) must be prescribed and weekly antenatal visits should be arranged with additional visits if necessary.
-	A full blood count should be done to exclude a low platelet count.
