title: Primary Maternal Care. Test 2. Assessment of fetal growth and condition during pregnancy

Which of the following statements about intra-uterine growth restriction is correct?
-	The cause of severe intra-uterine growth restriction is usually unknown.
+	Both maternal and fetal factors may cause intra-uterine growth restriction.
-	Primary placental insufficiency is a common cause of intra-uterine growth restriction.
-	Poor maternal weight gain during pregnancy is of great value in the diagnosis of intra-uterine growth restriction.

Which of the following is the best clinical method of determining uterine growth between 18 and 36 weeks of pregnancy?
-	An abdominal examination
+	The distance in centimetres between the upper edge of the symphysis pubis and the fundus of the uterus
-	Serial ultrasound examinations at each antenatal visit
-	The abdominal circumference measured with a tape at each antenatal visit

Which of the following symphysis-fundus height measurements suggests intra-uterine growth restriction?
-	A slowing of the symphysis-fundus growth until 2 measurements are below the 10th centile
+	A slowing of the symphysis-fundus growth until one measurement is below the 10th centile
-	2 measurements the same irrespective of their positions on the centile lines
-	A measurement that is less than that recorded two visits before and falls below the 10th centile

With severe intra-uterine growth restriction, the difference between the gestational age and the symphysis-fundus height measurement is:
-	2 weeks or more
-	3 weeks or more
+	4 weeks or more
-	5 weeks or more

If the symphysis-fundus measurement suggests intra-uterine growth restriction at 32 weeks gestation, what is the correct management?
-	A vaginal examination must be done to determine whether the patient’s cervix is favourable for an induction.
-	The patient must return to the antenatal clinic at 36 weeks.
-	Fetal heart rate monitoring must be done at each antenatal visit.
+	The patient must be transferred to a level 2 hospital for a Doppler umbilical artery blood flow measurement.

The fetal condition can best be determined during the antenatal period by:
-	Weighing the patient at every antenatal visit
-	Measuring the patient’s blood pressure
-	Counting the fetal heart rate
+	Counting fetal movements

During the antenatal period it is essential to determine the fetal condition from:
-	36 weeks
-	34 weeks
+	28 weeks
-	24 weeks

Which of the following statements about fetal movements is correct?
-	The date when fetal movements are first felt is a good indication of the gestational age.
-	Good fetal movements do not necessarily indicate fetal wellbeing.
+	From 28 weeks, all patients should be told about the importance of fetal movements.
-	A decrease in fetal movements always indicates that the fetus is distressed.

Which patients should use a fetal movement chart?
+	All patients, where there is reason to be worried about the fetal condition
-	All primigravidas
-	All pregnant patients from 28 weeks gestation
-	All patients who have had a previous Caesarean section

When will you be worried that a patient may have a decreased number of fetal movements?
-	15–20 movements per hour
-	10–15 movements per hour
-	5–10 movements per hour
+	Half as many fetal movements as previously counted

What would you advise if a patient felt only a few fetal movements during an hour?
-	The patient must go to her nearest clinic immediately and report that her fetus is only moving a little.
+	The patient should lie on her side for a further hour and count the fetal movements.
-	The patient should repeat the fetal movement count in the afternoon.
-	Antenatal fetal heart rate monitoring is indicated and, therefore, she must report to her nearest hospital.

What management would be correct if a patient with reduced fetal movements presents at a hospital that does not have a cardiotocograph (CTG machine)?
-	The responsible doctor must see the patient immediately as a Caesarean section should be done.
-	Refer the patient urgently to a hospital that has a cardiotocograph.
+	Exclude the possibility of fetal death by listening for the fetal heart with a stethoscope.
-	Fetal movements must be counted again the next day.

How should a doctor manage a patient which has decreased fetal movements and a viable fetus, without any signs of intra-uterine growth restriction? The duration of pregnancy is 36 weeks.
+	If the cervix is favourable for induction of labour, the membranes must be ruptured and the fetal heart must be monitored carefully.
-	An emergency Caesarean section must be performed immediately, irrespective of the state of the cervix.
-	If the cervix is unfavourable, a medical induction of labour, using prostaglandin E2, must be performed.
-	Delivery to only take place in a level 2 hospital with neonatal intensive care unit or a level 3 hospital.

Which of the following statements about antenatal fetal heart rate monitoring is correct?
-	Fetal heart rate monitoring should be done on all patients with pre-eclampsia, as fetal movements in these patients are an unreliable method of assessing the condition of the fetus.
-	All pregnant patients should routinely have antenatal fetal heart rate monitoring.
-	Antenatal fetal heart rate monitoring should be done on all patients with suspected intra-uterine growth restriction.
+	Antenatal fetal heart rate monitoring should be done on high-risk patients where fetal movements have not been shown to be a reliable method of assessing the fetal condition, such as insulin-dependent diabetics, prelabour rupture of the membranes and pre-eclampsia which is being managed conservatively.

If there is a non-reactive fetal heart rate pattern: 
-	No decelerations occur despite uterine contractions.
-	Fetal distress should be suspected and intra-uterine resuscitation must be undertaken.
-	The test must be repeated after 45 minutes.
+	The variability must be assessed to determine the presence or absence of fetal wellbeing.

Why must you repeat the test 45 minutes after a non-reactive fetal heart rate pattern, with poor beat-to-beat variability, is obtained?
-	Supine hypotension or spontaneous hyperstimulation of the uterus may be present.
-	Such a fetal heart rate pattern indicates fetal distress and the test must be repeated immediately.
+	A sleeping fetus may produce a non-reactive fetal heart rate pattern with poor beat-to-beat variability.
-	Cardiotocography must be repeated after 45 minutes whenever the fetal heart rate pattern indicates fetal distress.

Which of the following results indicates an abnormal stress test?
-	No decelerations after 2 contractions that last at least 30 seconds each
+	Uterine contractions with late decelerations
-	A fetal tachycardia with a baseline rate above 160 beats per minute
-	No accelerations

Which of the following indicates a late deceleration on a cardiotocogram?
-	The trough of the deceleration occurs at least 60 seconds after the peak of the contraction.
-	The trough of the deceleration occurs at least 45 seconds after the peak of the contraction.
+	The trough of the deceleration occurs at least 30 seconds after the peak of the contraction.
-	A deceleration during a contraction that takes 30 seconds or more after the end of the contraction to return to the baseline.

Which form of management will be correct if a fetal heart rate pattern, which indicates fetal distress, is obtained?
+	As the test result may be falsely abnormal due to postural hypotension or overstimulation of the uterus, these possibilities must first be ruled out.
-	Repeat the stress test on the same day.
-	Repeat the stress test 4 hours later.
-	Perform an immediate Caesarean section.

What is the correct method of intra-uterine resuscitation?
+	Suppressing uterine contractions and decreasing the uterine tone
-	Administering oxygen to the fetus by means of an intra-uterine catheter
-	Infusing oxytocin in order to stimulate uterine contractions
-	Rubbing the patient’s nipples so as to stimulate uterine contractions
