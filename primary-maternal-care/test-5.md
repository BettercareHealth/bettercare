# Test 5: Preterm labour and preterm rupture of the membranes

1.	What is the definition of preterm labour?
	-	Labour starting one hour or more after rupture of the membranes.
	-	Labour starting before 40 weeks of gestation.
	+	Labour starting before 37 weeks of gestation.
	-	Labour starting when the fetus is assessed as weighing less than 2000 g, when the gestational age is unknown.
2.	Preterm rupture of the membranes is defined as:
	-	Membranes that have ruptured at term, and not been followed by the onset of labour within 24 hours.
	-	Membranes that rupture before the second stage of labour.
	+	Membranes that have ruptured before 37 weeks of gestation, in the absence of contractions.
	-	Membranes that have ruptured before the onset of labour at any gestational age.
3.	Preterm labour is important because it commonly results in death of the infant due to:
	-	Abruptio placentae.
	-	Birth trauma.
	-	Jaundice.
	+	Hyaline membrane disease.
4.	Chorioamnionitis is usually caused by:
	-	Bacteria which cross the placenta from the maternal circulation to the fetus.
	+	Bacteria which spread from the cervix and vagina.
	-	Viral infection of the genitalia.
	-	Candida vaginitis.
5.	Choose the correct statement regarding chorioamnionitis:
	-	It causes all cases of preterm labour.
	-	It always follows preterm rupture of the membranes.
	+	It may cause and complicate preterm rupture of the membranes.
	-	It only occurs in patients with vaginitis.
6.	Subclinical chorioamnionitis usually results in:
	+	No signs or symptoms in the mother or fetus.
	-	Maternal pyrexia and tachycardia.
	-	An offensive vaginal discharge.
	-	Abdominal tenderness.
7.	Clinical chorioamnionitis may present with:
	-	Headache and backache.
	-	Vaginal bleeding.
	+	Fetal tachycardia.
	-	Dysuria and frequency.
8.	Antibiotics should be given to:
	-	All patients with preterm rupture of the membranes.
	-	All infants with preterm labour.
	+	Patients with clinical signs of chorioamnionitis.
	-	Patients with ruptured membranes, where the pregnancy is allowed to continue.
9.	Which of the following commonly causes preterm labour?
	+	Multiple pregnancy.
	-	Excessive weight gain during pregnancy.
	-	A breech presentation.
	-	No sexual intercourse in the second half of pregnancy.
10.	Which patients are at the highest risk of preterm labour?
	-	Patients who book early in pregnancy.
	-	Multigravidas.
	+	Patients with a history of preterm labour in a previous pregnancy.
	-	Patients living in low socio-economic circumstances.
11.	Women at increased risk of preterm labour should:
	-	Increase their normal amount of exercise.
	-	Not take baths.
	-	Not be examined vaginally at the antenatal clinics.
	+	Avoid coitus during the second half of their pregnancies.
12.	Braxton Hicks contractions:
	+	Are sometimes uncomfortable but are not painful.
	-	Are regular.
	-	Are associated with cervical dilatation.
	-	Increase in duration and frequency.
13.	Preterm labour is present when:
	-	A patient experiences painful contractions prior to 37 weeks.
	-	Regular uterine contractions, palpable on abdominal examination prior to 37 weeks is present.
	+	Regular uterine contractions, palpable on abdominal examination and cervical effacement and/or dilatation on vaginal examination prior to 37 weeks.
	-	A patient has a history of rupture of the membranes prior to 37 weeks irrespective of whether or not she has uterine contractions.
14.	Patients with preterm rupture of the membranes should have:
	-	A digital vaginal examination to assess the state of the cervix.
	+	A sterile speculum examination only.
	-	No vaginal examination at all.
	-	Only a rectal examination.
15.	The pH of amniotic fluid is:
	-	Acid.
	-	Neutral.
	+	Alkaline.
	-	Variable.
16.	How should a patient with preterm labour at a gestational age of 36 weeks be managed?
	+	The patient should be delivered in a MOU or district hospital.
	-	The patient should be delivered in a level 1 facility.
	-	The patient should be referred to a level 2 facility for delivery.
	-	Preterm labour should be suppressed and the patient transferred to a level 1 facility for further suppression of preterm labour.
17.	What should be done if preterm labour has been diagnosed at a primary care antenatal clinic and the patient is less than 34 weeks pregnant?
	+	Contractions need to be suppressed and the patient referred urgently to a level 2 hospital.
	-	Contractions need to be suppressed and the patient referred urgently to a level&nbsp;1 hospital.
	-	There is no time to suppress contractions as this will only delay the urgent transfer of the patient.
	-	If the cervix is less than 2 cm dilated it is better to wait to see if further dilatation occurs before transfer is arranged.
18.	How would you decide that a patient is less than 34 weeks pregnant if the duration of the pregnancy is unknown?
	-	The estimated fetal weight will be less than 2500 g and the syphysis-fundus measurement will be less than 34 cm.
	+	The estimated fetal weight will be less than 2000 g and the syphysis-fundus measurement will be less than 33 cm.
	-	If in doubt the patient should be referred to a level 2 hospital to be evaluated.
	-	An ultrasound examination needs to be done urgently to establish the correct gestational age.
19.	Salbutamol should not be used in a patient with:
	-	Asthma.
	-	Preterm rupture of the membranes.
	-	Multiple pregnancy.
	+	Heart valve disease.
20.	What advice should be given to a patient who had a preterm delivery?
	-	If she only had one previous preterm delivery, there is no need to be concerned about future pregnancies.
	-	There is a high risk of recurrence, it will be better not to attempt future pregnancies.
	-	Intervention is only required if a patient had two previous preterm deliveries.
	+	The patient should be seen at a level&nbsp;2 hospital before her next pregnancy to be assessed for possible causes.
