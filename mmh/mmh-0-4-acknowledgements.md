*Maternal Mental Health* has drawn from material from the Perinatal Mental Health Project’s *Maternal Mental Health: A handbook for health workers*. The handbook can be found online at http://www.pmhp.za.org/learn/pmhp-resources. 

The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions made to the content of the handbook by: Emily Baron, Bronwyn Evans, Sheila Faure, Angela Hutchison, Linda Lewis, Ingrid Meintjes, Natasa Meli, Karen Miller, Liz Mills, Songelwa Mobo, Joan Raphael-Leff, Hilary Rosenthal, Lisa Sanders, Bridget Schweitzer, Sarah Skeen and Julie van der Vlugt. 

Graeme Arendse created the illustrations (email: boeta.gee@gmail.com).

We acknowledge all colleagues who have made suggestions and offered constructive criticism. It is only through constant feedback that the content of the Perinatal Education Programme can be improved. 

We are particularly grateful to the Harry Crossley Foundation for their generous funding for the production of this book.
