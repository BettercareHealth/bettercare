# Test 3: Care of low-birth-weight infants

Please choose the ONE most correct answer to each question:

1.	Low-birth-weight infants weigh:
	1.	Less than 3000 g
	1.	Less than 2500 g
	1.	Less than 2000 g
	1.	Less than 1500 g
2.	A preterm infant is defined as an infant with a gestational age:
	1.	Less than 35 weeks
	1.	Less than 36 weeks
	1.	Less than 37 weeks
	1.	Less than 38 weeks
3.	Infants that are underweight for gestational age have a birth weight that falls:
	1.	Below the 90th centile
	1.	Between the 10th and 90th centiles
	1.	Below the 10th centile
	1.	Below the 3rd centile
4.	Loose, wrinkled dry skin and loss of muscle in an infant at birth suggests:
	1.	Preterm delivery
	1.	Wasting
	1.	An overweight mother
	1.	Septicaemia
5.	The gestational age of an infant can be estimated after delivery by:
	1.	Weighing the infant
	1.	Measuring the infant’s head circumference
	1.	Measuring the infant’s haemoglobin concentration
	1.	Examining the infant’s physical features and assessing the neurological behaviour
6.	Which is a common cause of preterm delivery?
	1.	Male infant
	1.	Chorioamnionitis
	1.	Overweight mother
	1.	Syphilis
7.	Infants that are born preterm have an increased incidence of:
	1.	Meconium aspiration syndrome
	1.	Wasting
	1.	Hypothermia
	1.	Pyrexia
8.	Underweight-for-gestational-age infants are at an increased risk of:
	1.	Hypoglycaemia
	1.	Birth trauma
	1.	Hyaline membrane disease
	1.	Infection
9.	Hypothermia is defined as a skin temperature below:
	1.	37 °C
	1.	36 °C
	1.	30 °C
	1.	25 °C
10.	What should be done to prevent hypothermia?
	1.	Dry infants well after delivery
	1.	Delay feeding infants until they are 6 hours old
	1.	Do not give the infant to the mother immediately after delivery
	1.	Only discharge infants home when they are at least 24 hours old
11.	What should you consider when deciding on the correct incubator temperature?
	1.	The infant’s weight
	1.	The infant’s sex
	1.	The infant’s haemoglobin concentration
	1.	The Apgar score
12.	The normal blood glucose concentration in a newborn infant is:
	1.	Less than 2.0 mmol/l
	1.	2.0 mmol/l to 7.0 mmol/l
	1.	1.4 mmol/l to 10 mmol/l
	1.	7.0 mmol/l to 12 mmol/l
13.	How can the risk of hypoglycaemia be decreased?
	1.	Start an intravenous infusion in all low-birth-weight infants after delivery
	1.	Feed infants as soon as possible after birth
	1.	Add sugar to the formula feeds of all low-birth-weight infants
	1.	Do not allow preterm infants to breastfeed for the first 5 days
14.	Apnoea is diagnosed when:
	1.	An infant stops breathing for 5 seconds
	1.	An infant stops breathing for 15 seconds but remains pink
	1.	An infant becomes cyanosed but does not stop breathing
	1.	An infant stops breathing for 20 seconds and develops cyanosis and bradycardia
15.	The fluid volume needed by a term infant on day 1 is:
	1.	25 ml/kg
	1.	60 ml/kg
	1.	100 ml/kg
	1.	150 ml/kg
16.	Infants need less fluid on the first few days of life because:
	1.	They weigh less
	1.	They do not suck well
	1.	Their stools consist of meconium
	1.	Their kidneys only produce a little urine
17.	The best milk for most low-birth-weight infants is:
	1.	A soya bean formula
	1.	Special preterm formula
	1.	Breast milk
	1.	Standard infant formula
18.	An infant between 1500 and 1800 g should be fed:
	1.	12 times a day
	1.	8 times a day
	1.	6 times a day
	1.	On demand
19.	What supplements should a preterm infant receive?
	1.	Ferro Drops 1 ml daily from day 7
	1.	Ferro Drops 0.3 ml daily, starting when the infant starts to suck
	1.	Multivitamin drops 0.3 ml daily starting when the infant takes full volume feeds of 150 ml/kg/day
	1.	Multivitamin drops 0.1 ml with each feed
20.	What is the normal range of packed cell volume (PCV) at birth?
	1.	10–25%
	1.	25–45%
	1.	45–65%
	1.	65–75%
