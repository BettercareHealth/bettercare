# Test 3: Care of low-birth-weight infants

Please choose the one most correct answer to each question or statement.

1.	Low-birth-weight infants weigh:
	-	Less than 3000 g
	+	Less than 2500 g
	-	Less than 2000 g
	-	Less than 1500 g
2.	A preterm infant is defined as an infant with a gestational age:
	-	Less than 35 weeks
	-	Less than 36 weeks
	+	Less than 37 weeks
	-	Less than 38 weeks
3.	Infants that are underweight-for-gestational-age have a birth weight that falls:
	-	Below the 90th centile
	-	Between the 10th and 90th centiles
	+	Below the 10th centile
	-	Below the 3rd centile
4.	Loose, wrinkled dry skin and loss of muscle in an infant at birth suggests:
	-	Preterm delivery
	+	Wasting
	-	An overweight mother
	-	Septicaemia
5.	The gestational age of an infant can be estimated after delivery by:
	-	Weighing the infant
	-	Measuring the infant’s head circumference
	-	Measuring the infant’s haemoglobin concentration
	+	Examining the infant’s physical features and assessing the neurological behaviour
6.	Which is a common cause of preterm delivery?
	-	Male infant
	+	Chorioamnionitis
	-	Overweight mother
	-	Syphilis
7.	Infants that are born preterm have an increased incidence of:
	-	Meconium aspiration syndrome
	-	Wasting
	+	Hypothermia
	-	Pyrexia
8.	Underweight-for-gestational-age infants are at an increased risk of:
	+	Hypoglycaemia
	-	Birth trauma
	-	Hyaline membrane disease
	-	Infection
9.	Hypothermia is defined as a skin temperature below:
	-	37 °C
	+	36 °C
	-	30 °C
	-	25 °C
10.	What should be done to prevent hypothermia?
	+	Dry infants well after delivery
	-	Delay feeding infants until they are 6 hours old
	-	Do not give the infant to the mother immediately after delivery
	-	Only discharge infants home when they are at least 24 hours old
11.	What should you consider when deciding on the correct incubator temperature?
	+	The infant’s weight
	-	The infant’s sex
	-	The infant’s haemoglobin concentration
	-	The Apgar score
12.	The normal blood glucose concentration in a newborn infant is:
	-	Less than 2.5 mmol/l
	+	2.5 mmol/l to 7.0 mmol/l
	-	1.4 mmol/l to 10 mmol/l
	-	7.0 mmol/l to 12 mmol/l
13.	How can the risk of hypoglycaemia be decreased?
	-	Start an intravenous infusion in all low-birth-weight infants after delivery
	+	Feed infants as soon as possible after birth
	-	Add sugar to the formula feeds of all low-birth-weight infants
	-	Do not allow preterm infants to breastfeed for the first 5 days
14.	Apnoea is diagnosed when:
	-	An infant stops breathing for 5 seconds
	-	An infant stops breathing for 15 seconds but remains pink
	-	An infant becomes cyanosed but does not stop breathing
	+	An infant stops breathing for 20 seconds and develops cyanosis and bradycardia
15.	The fluid volume needed by a term infant on day 1 is:
	-	25 ml/kg
	+	60 ml/kg
	-	100 ml/kg
	-	150 ml/kg
16.	Infants need less fluid on the first few days of life because:
	-	They weigh less
	-	They do not suck well
	-	Their stools consist of meconium
	+	Their kidneys only produce a little urine
17.	The best milk for most low-birth-weight infants is:
	-	A soya bean formula
	-	Special preterm formula
	+	Breast milk
	-	Standard infant formula
18.	An infant between 1500 and 1800 g should be fed:
	-	12 times a day
	+	8 times a day
	-	6 times a day
	-	On demand
19.	What supplements should a preterm infant receive?
	-	Ferro Drops 1 ml daily from day 7
	-	Ferro Drops 0.3 ml daily, starting when the infant starts to suck
	+	Multivitamin drops 0.3 ml daily starting when the infant takes full volume feeds of 150 ml/kg/day
	-	Multivitamin drops 0.1 ml with each feed
20.	What is the normal range of packed cell volume (PCV) at birth?
	-	10–25%
	-	25–45%
	+	45–65%
	-	65–75%
