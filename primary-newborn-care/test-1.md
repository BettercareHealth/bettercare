Please choose the one most correct answer to each question or statement.

1.	When should the umbilical cord be clamped in a normal infant?
	+	At 2 to 3 minutes after delivery
	-	After the infant has been breathing well for 5 minutes
	-	Immediately after delivery
	-	After the placenta has been delivered
2.	When should the infant be given to the mother?
	-	After the mother has had a chance to sleep
	+	As soon as possible
	-	When the infant has had a bath
	-	It does not matter when the infant is given to the mother
3.	Which infants should receive vitamin K1 (Konakion) after delivery?
	-	Only preterm infants
	-	Only infants with a low Apgar score
	-	Only infants who have had a traumatic or difficult delivery
	+	All infants
4.	What should be placed in the eyes of infants after birth?
	-	Nothing
	-	Sterile water to remove meconium or vernix
	+	An antibiotic ointment such as chloromycetin
	-	Colostrum
5.	A newborn infant is said to have failed to breathe well at delivery:
	-	If the infant does not breathe well immediately after delivery
	-	If the infant’s hands and feet are still blue at 1 minute after delivery
	-	If the infant has not cried by 5 minutes after delivery
	+	If the infant does not breathe well or cry after it has been well dried
6.	Which vital sign is included in the Apgar score?
	-	Temperature
	+	Heart rate
	-	Meconium staining
	-	Oedema 
7.	The Apgar score at 1 minute should be determined: 
	+	In all newborn infants
	-	Only when there have been signs of fetal distress
	-	Only if the infant does not breathe well after birth
	-	Only if the infant needs mask ventilation
8.	What is the value of the 1 minute Apgar score?
	-	It predicts brain damage
	-	It confirms fetal hypoxia
	+	It is used to document the infant’s clinical condition after birth
	-	It is used to assess gestational age
9.	What is the value of the 5 minute Apgar score?
	+	It indicates whether the infant is responding to resuscitation
	-	If less than 7, it confirms that the infant will die
	-	If 7 or more, it confirms that the infant will survive
	-	It is used to decide whether cardiac massage is needed
10.	A normal Apgar score at 1 minute is:
	-	Above 10
	+	7–10
	-	3–7
	-	Less than 3
11.	What is a common cause of a low Apgar score?
	-	Hypothermia
	+	Excessive suctioning of the mouth and throat
	-	Infection
	-	Hyaline membrane disease
12.	Fetal hypoxia is defined as:
	-	Failure to breathe after delivery
	-	A low 1 minute Apgar score
	+	Too little oxygen to the fetus
	-	Intra-uterine death
13.	After delivery the following infants should have their mouth and throat suctioned:
	-	Preterm infants
	-	Infants born by Caesarean section
	+	Infants that fail to breathe well after stimulation
	-	All newborn infants
14.	Which health workers need to be able to resuscitate infants:
	-	Doctors only
	-	Midwives only
	-	Doctors and senior midwives only
	+	All those who conduct deliveries
15.	What is the most important step in resuscitating an infant?
	+	Giving bag-and-mask ventilation
	-	Starting cardiac massage
	-	Cooling the infant
	-	Giving naloxone by intramuscular injection
16.	An infant who still has a slow heart rate after receiving bag-and-mask ventilation should: 
	+	Be given chest compressions
	-	Be given vitamin K1 (Konakion)
	-	Be given adrenaline
	-	Receive no further resuscitation as it has probably suffered brain damage
17.	Naloxone (Narcan) reverses the respiratory depression caused by:
	-	Barbiturates
	-	General anaesthesia
	-	Diazepam (Valium)
	+	Pethidine and morphine
18.	If an infant is heavily meconium stained at delivery:
	-	It is important to stimulate respiration before suctioning the airways
	+	The mouth should be suctioned before the shoulders are delivered
	-	The mouth should only be suctioned after the infant is completely delivered
	-	Only the nose should be suctioned
19.	Which size of catheter should be used to suction a meconium-stained infant at birth?
	-	F 3.5
	-	F 5
	-	F 6
	+	F 10
20.	A stomach washout should be given to:
	-	All low-birth-weight infants
	-	Infants with a low 1 minute Apgar score
	+	Infants who vomit thick meconium
	-	All meconium-stained infants
