	1.	As soon as possible

	1.	It does not matter when the infant is given to the mother
3.	Which infants should receive vitamin K (Konakion) after delivery?
	1.	Only preterm infants
	1.	Only infants with a low Apgar score
	1.	Only infants who have had a traumatic or difficult delivery
	1.	All infants
4.	What should be placed in the eyes of infants after birth?
	1.	Nothing
	1.	Sterile water to remove meconium or vernix
	1.	An antibiotic ointment such as chloromycetin
	1.	Colostrum
5.	A newborn infant is said to have failed to breathe well at delivery:
	1.	If the infant does not breathe well immediately after delivery
	1.	If the infant’s hands and feet are still blue at 1 minute after delivery
	1.	If the infant has not cried by 5 minutes after delivery
	1.	If the infant does not breathe well or cry after it has been well dried
6.	Which vital sign is included in the Apgar score?
	1.	Temperature
	1.	Heart rate
	1.	Meconium staining
	1.	Oedema 
7.	The Apgar score at 1 minute should be determined: 
	1.	In all newborn infants
	1.	Only when there have been signs of fetal distress
	1.	Only if the infant does not breathe well after birth
	1.	Only if the infant needs mask ventilation
8.	What is the value of the 1 minute Apgar score?
	1.	It predicts brain damage
	1.	It confirms fetal hypoxia
	1.	It is used to document the infant’s clinical condition after birth
	1.	It is used to assess gestational age
9.	What is the value of the 5 minute Apgar score?
	1.	It indicates whether the infant is responding to resuscitation
	1.	If less than 7, it confirms that the infant will die
	1.	If 7 or more, it confirms that the infant will survive
	1.	It is used to decide whether cardiac massage is needed
10.	A normal Apgar score at 1 minute is:
	1.	Above 10
	1.	7–10
	1.	3–7
	1.	Less than 3
11.	What is a common cause of a low Apgar score?
	1.	Hypothermia
	1.	Excessive suctioning of the mouth and throat
	1.	Infection
	1.	Hyaline membrane disease
12.	Fetal hypoxia is defined as:
	1.	Failure to breathe after delivery
	1.	A low 1 minute Apgar score
	1.	Too little oxygen in the fetus
	1.	Intra-uterine death
13.	After delivery the following infants should have their mouth and throat suctioned:
	1.	Preterm infants
	1.	Infants born by Caesarean section
	1.	Infants that fail to breathe well after stimulation
	1.	All newborn infants

	1.	Midwives only
	1.	Doctors and senior midwives only
	1.	All staff who conduct deliveries
15.	What is the most important step in resuscitating an infant?
	1.	Giving bag-and-mask ventilation
	1.	Starting cardiac massage
	1.	Cooling the infant
	1.	Giving naloxone by intramuscular injection
16.	An infant who still has a slow heart rate after receiving bag-and-mask ventilation should: 
	1.	Be given chest compressions
	1.	Be given vitamin K (Konakion)
	1.	Be given adrenaline
	1.	Receive no further resuscitation as it has probably suffered brain damage
17.	Naloxone (Narcan) reverses the respiratory depression caused by:
	1.	Barbiturates
	1.	General anaesthesia
	1.	Diazepam (Valium)
	1.	Pethidine and morphine
18.	If an infant is heavily meconium stained at delivery:
	1.	It is important to stimulate respiration before suctioning the airways
	1.	The mouth should be suctioned before the shoulders are delivered
	1.	The mouth should only be suctioned after the infant is completely delivered
	1.	Only the nose should be suctioned
19.	Which size of catheter should be used to suction a meconium-stained infant at birth?

	1.	F 5
	1.	F 6
	1.	F 10
20.	A stomach washout should be given to:
