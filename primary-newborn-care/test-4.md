# Test 4: Emergency management of infants

1.	The body temperature of a newborn infant should be measured by placing a mercury thermometer:
	-	In the mouth
	-	In the rectum
	+	In the axilla (arm pit)
	-	In the incubator
2.	The normal abdominal skin temperature in a newborn infant is:
	-	35.5–36.0 °C
	+	36.0–36.5 °C
	-	36.5–37.0 °C
	-	37.0–37.5 °C
3.	Glucose is stored in the body as glycogen in:
	-	The brain
	-	The red blood cells
	+	The liver
	-	Fat
4.	Hypoglycaemia is dangerous as it may cause:
	-	Jaundice
	+	Brain damage
	-	Anaemia
	-	Bleeding
5.	Which infants are at an increased risk of hypoglycaemia?
	-	Infants who are breastfed
	-	Female infants
	+	Underweight-for-gestational-age infants
	-	Jaundiced infants
6.	Hypoglycaemia:
	-	Always presents with clinical signs
	-	Never presents with clinical signs
	+	May present with clinical signs
	-	Usually kills the infant
7.	What is the treatment of mild hypoglycaemia?
	+	Give a milk feed
	-	Start an intravenous infusion
	-	Give a single dose of hydrocortisone
	-	Give insulin
8.	Severe hypoglycaemia in a preterm infant is best treated by:
	-	Feeding the infant with breast milk
	-	Giving 5% dextrose by nasogastric tube
	-	Giving 50% dextrose by a nasogastric tube
	+	Starting an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose
9.	If an infant develops severe hypoglycaemia you should:
	-	Repeat the blood glucose measurement in 30 minutes to assess whether it has improved
	+	Treat the hypoglycaemia immediately
	-	Refer the infant to the nearest newborn intensive care (level 3) unit for treatment
	-	Try to contact a more senior staff member to treat the infant
10.	Which one of the following clinical signs is used to diagnose respiratory distress?
	-	Pallor
	-	Decreased air entry of the chest
	+	Recession
	-	Pyrexia
11.	Tachypnoea in a newborn is defined as a respiratory rate greater than:
	-	20 breaths per minute
	-	40 breaths per minute
	+	60 breaths per minute
	-	80 breaths per minute
12.	What is a common cause of respiratory distress?
	-	Starvation
	-	Jaundice
	+	Wet lung syndrome
	-	Meningitis
13.	Hyaline membrane disease is caused by:
	+	Too little surfactant
	-	Too much surfactant
	-	Infection
	-	Too much fluid in the lungs
14.	A negative shake test on a sample of gastric aspirate after birth in an infant with respiratory distress suggests a diagnosis of:
	-	Wet lung syndrome
	-	Pneumonia
	-	Pneumothorax
	+	Hyaline membrane disease
15.	Hyaline membrane disease is commonly seen in:
	-	Meconium-stained infants
	+	Preterm infants
	-	Underweight-for-gestational-age infants
	-	Post-term infants
16.	Hyaline membrane disease can be expected to:
	-	Improve steadily after birth
	-	Steadily become worse after birth for about 6 hours then improve
	+	Steadily become worse after birth for 48 to 72 hours before starting to improve
	-	Only start to recover after 1 week
17.	Wet lung syndrome:
	+	Improves during the first 2 to 3 days
	-	Gradually gets worse after delivery
	-	Should be treated with antibiotics
	-	Is usually fatal
18.	What is the normal oxygen saturation in the arterial blood of a newborn infant?
	-	80–85%
	+	86–92%
	-	90–95%
	-	95–100%
19.	Excess oxygen in the inspired air may cause:
	-	Deafness
	+	Blindness
	-	Paralysis
	-	Mental retardation
20.	The amount of oxygen in a headbox can be accurately determined by: 
	-	Deciding whether the tongue is pink or cyanosed
	-	Measuring the flow of oxygen into the head box
	-	Using a saturation monitor
	+	Using an oxygen monitor
