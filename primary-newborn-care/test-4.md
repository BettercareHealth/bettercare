	1.	The red blood cells
	1.	The liver
	1.	Fat
4.	Hypoglycaemia is dangerous as it may cause:
	1.	Jaundice
	1.	Brain damage

	1.	Bleeding
5.	Which infants are at an increased risk of hypoglycaemia?
	1.	Infants who are breastfed
	1.	Female infants
	1.	Underweight-for-gestational-age infants
	1.	Jaundiced infants
6.	Hypoglycaemia:
	1.	Always presents with clinical signs
	1.	Never presents with clinical signs
	1.	May present with clinical signs
	1.	Usually kills the infant
7.	What is the treatment of mild hypoglycaemia?
	1.	Give a milk feed
	1.	Start an intravenous infusion
	1.	Give a single dose of hydrocortisone
	1.	Give insulin
8.	Severe hypoglycaemia in a preterm infant is best treated by:
	1.	Feeding the infant with breast milk
	1.	Giving 5% dextrose by nasogastric tube
	1.	Giving 50% dextrose by a nasogastric tube
	1.	Starting an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose
9.	If an infant develops severe hypoglycaemia you should:
	1.	Repeat the blood glucose measurement in 30 minutes to assess whether it has improved
	1.	Treat the hypoglycaemia immediately
	1.	Refer the infant to the nearest newborn intensive care (level 3) unit for treatment
	1.	Try to contact a more senior staff member to treat the infant

13.	Hyaline membrane disease is caused by:
	1.	Too little surfactant
	1.	Too much surfactant
	1.	Infection
	1.	Too much fluid in the lungs
14.	A negative shake test on a sample of gastric aspirate after birth in an infant with respiratory distress suggests a diagnosis of:
