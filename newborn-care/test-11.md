# Test 11: Oxygen therapy

1.	Metabolism requiring oxygen is called:
	1.	Oxidation
	1.	Anaerobic metabolism
	1.	Anabolic metabolism
	1.	Aerobic metabolism `correct`{:.correct-answer}
2.	Most oxygen is carried in the blood by:
	1.	The red blood cells `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	The white blood cells
	1.	The platelets
	1.	The serum
3.	What is the normal concentration of oxygen in room air?
	1.	20%
	1.	21% `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	22%
	1.	30%
4.	The amount of oxygen carried in the blood can be accurately determined by: 
	1.	Deciding whether the tongue is pink or cyanosed
	1.	Measuring the flow of oxygen into the head box
	1.	Using a pulse oximeter `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	Using an oxygen monitor
5.	What is the abbreviation for the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood?
	1.	PaO₂ `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	SaO₂
	1.	FiO₂
	1.	O₂
6.	What is the normal partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood of a healthy newborn infant?
	1.	6–8 kPa
	1.	8–10 kPa `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	10–12 kPa
	1.	12–20 kPa
7.	What is the normal oxygen saturation in the arterial blood of a newborn infant?
	1.	80–86%
	1.	86–92% `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	92–95%
	1.	95–100%
8.	When oxygen is given to infants it is usually blended with:
	1.	Nitrogen
	1.	Air `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	Carbon dioxide
	1.	Hydrogen
9.	Lack of enough oxygen in inspired air may:
	1.	Damage the airways.
	1.	Damage the red cells.
	1.	Damage the brain. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	None of the above.
10.	Extra oxygen should be given to:
	1.	All infants at birth
	1.	All infants under 1500 g
	1.	All infants with peripheral cyanosis
	1.	All infants with central cyanosis `correct`{:.correct-answer}
11.	What is a safe concentration of inspired oxygen?
	1.	0.40 (i.e. 40%)
	1.	0.25 (i.e. 25%)
	1.	0.10 (i.e. 10%)
	1.	Any FiO₂ that gives a normal partial pressure or normal saturation of oxygen in the blood `correct`{:.correct-answer}
12.	Excess oxygen in the inspired air may cause:
	1.	Deafness
	1.	Blindness `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	Paralysis
	1.	Mental retardation
13.	Retinopathy of prematurity is usually seen:
	1.	In underweight for gestational age infants
	1.	In preterm infants `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	In infants who have been removed from oxygen too soon
	1.	In infants who have not been given extra oxygen
14.	Retinopathy of prematurity can be largely prevented by:
	1.	Carefully controlling the PaO₂ or SaO₂ `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	Never giving extra oxygen
	1.	Never giving 100% oxygen
	1.	Humidifying the oxygen
15.	100% oxygen may damage the infant and therefore:
	1.	Should never be given to any infant
	1.	Should not be given for more than 24 hours
	1.	Should only be given if a lower concentration of oxygen fails to correct central cyanosis `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	Should never be given to a preterm infant
16.	Oxygen given via an endotracheal tube should be:
	1.	Cooled and humidified
	1.	Warmed and humidified `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	Sterilised
	1.	Warmed only
17.	Extra oxygen is best given into:
	1.	A head box `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	An incubator
	1.	A face mask
	1.	A nasogastric tube
18.	The concentration of oxygen given to an infant is best controlled by:
	1.	Using a venturi or blender `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	1.	Altering the flow rate
	1.	Altering the size of the head box
	1.	Increasing or decreasing the amount of water in the humidifier
19.	To increase the concentration of oxygen that an infant is receiving:
	1.	Decrease the alarm limit on the oxygen monitor.
	1.	Increase the alarm limit on the oxygen monitor.
	1.	Decrease the fraction of oxygen given.
	1.	Increase the fraction of oxygen given. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
20.	The amount of extra oxygen given into a headbox should be measured:
	1.	As a flow rate (e.g. 5 litres per minute)
	1.	As a partial pressure (e.g. 5 kPa)
	1.	As a fraction (e.g. FiO₂ 0.5)
