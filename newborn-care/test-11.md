## Test 11: Oxygen therapy

1.	Metabolism requiring oxygen is called:
	-	Oxidation
	-	Anaerobic metabolism
	-	Anabolic metabolism
	+	Aerobic metabolism
2.	Most oxygen is carried in the blood by:
	+	The red blood cells
	-	The white blood cells
	-	The platelets
	-	The serum
3.	What is the normal concentration of oxygen in room air?
	-	20%
	+	21%
	-	22%
	-	30%
4.	The amount of oxygen carried in the blood can be accurately determined by: 
	-	Deciding whether the tongue is pink or cyanosed
	-	Measuring the flow of oxygen into the head box
	+	Using a pulse oximeter
	-	Using an oxygen monitor
5.	What is the abbreviation for the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood?
	+	PaO₂
	-	SaO₂
	-	FiO₂
	-	O₂
6.	What is the normal partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood of a healthy newborn infant?
	-	6–8 kPa
	+	8–10 kPa
	-	10–12 kPa
	-	12–20 kPa
7.	What is the normal oxygen saturation in the arterial blood of a newborn infant?
	-	80–86%
	+	86–92%
	-	92–95%
	-	95–100%
8.	When oxygen is given to infants it is usually blended with:
	-	Nitrogen
	+	Air
	-	Carbon dioxide
	-	Hydrogen
9.	Lack of enough oxygen in inspired air may:
	-	Damage the airways.
	-	Damage the red cells.
	+	Damage the brain.
	-	None of the above.
10.	Extra oxygen should be given to:
	-	All infants at birth
	-	All infants under 1500 g
	-	All infants with peripheral cyanosis
	+	All infants with central cyanosis
11.	What is a safe concentration of inspired oxygen?
	-	0.40 (i.e. 40%)
	-	0.25 (i.e. 25%)
	-	0.10 (i.e. 10%)
	+	Any FiO₂ that gives a normal partial pressure or normal saturation of oxygen in the blood
12.	Excess oxygen in the inspired air may cause:
	-	Deafness
	+	Blindness
	-	Paralysis
	-	Mental retardation
13.	Retinopathy of prematurity is usually seen:
	-	In underweight for gestational age infants
	+	In preterm infants
	-	In infants who have been removed from oxygen too soon
	-	In infants who have not been given extra oxygen
14.	Retinopathy of prematurity can be largely prevented by:
	+	Carefully controlling the PaO₂ or SaO₂
	-	Never giving extra oxygen
	-	Never giving 100% oxygen
	-	Humidifying the oxygen
15.	100% oxygen may damage the infant and therefore:
	-	Should never be given to any infant
	-	Should not be given for more than 24 hours
	+	Should only be given if a lower concentration of oxygen fails to correct central cyanosis
	-	Should never be given to a preterm infant
16.	Oxygen given via an endotracheal tube should be:
	-	Cooled and humidified
	+	Warmed and humidified
	-	Sterilised
	-	Warmed only
17.	Extra oxygen is best given into:
	+	A head box
	-	An incubator
	-	A face mask
	-	A nasogastric tube
18.	The concentration of oxygen given to an infant is best controlled by:
	+	Using a venturi or blender
	-	Altering the flow rate
	-	Altering the size of the head box
	-	Increasing or decreasing the amount of water in the humidifier
19.	To increase the concentration of oxygen that an infant is receiving:
	-	Decrease the alarm limit on the oxygen monitor.
	-	Increase the alarm limit on the oxygen monitor.
	-	Decrease the fraction of oxygen given.
	+	Increase the fraction of oxygen given.
20.	The amount of extra oxygen given into a headbox should be measured:
	-	As a flow rate (e.g. 5 litres per minute)
	-	As a partial pressure (e.g. 5 kPa)
	+	As a fraction (e.g. FiO₂ 0.5)
	-	As a weight (e.g. 500 g)
