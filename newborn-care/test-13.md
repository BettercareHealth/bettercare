## Test 13: Trauma and bleeding

1.	What is a caput succedaneum?
	-	A fracture of the skull
	+	Scalp oedema
	-	A bleed into the brain
	-	A bleed into the abdomen
2.	What is a cephalhaematoma?
	-	A bleed into the subaponeurotic space of the scalp
	-	A bleed into the subdural space
	+	A bleed under the periosteum of the parietal bone
	-	A bleed into the brain
3.	What is the management of a cephalhaematoma?
	-	Aspiration (removing the blood)
	-	Application of a compression bandage
	-	Antibiotics
	+	Reassurance of the parents
4.	A subaponeurotic haemorrhage:
	+	May cross the midline.
	-	Never crosses the midline.
	-	Does not cause pallor and shock.
	-	Is common.
5.	A traumatic forceps delivery may cause:
	-	A periventricular haemorrhage
	-	Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn
	-	Brachial palsy
	+	Subaponeurotic haemorrhage
6.	A facial palsy:
	+	Usually recovers spontaneously after a few days.
	-	Usually only recovers after a few months.
	-	Usually requires surgical decompression of the facial nerve.
	-	Usually does not recover.
7.	In an infant with a facial palsy:
	-	The infant is able to close the eye tightly on the side of the palsy.
	-	The mouth pulls to the side of the palsy.
	+	The mouth pulls away from the side of the palsy.
	-	The infant is unable to suck.
8.	A brachial palsy is most commonly seen in:
	-	Preterm infants born by vaginal delivery
	+	Large infants with impacted shoulders
	-	Infants born by elective Caesarean section
	-	Infants delivered by vacuum extraction
9.	What is the treatment of a brachial palsy?
	-	Keep the arm above the head.
	+	Passively move the arm a few times each day.
	-	Strap the arm to the chest.
	-	Treat pain with an analgesic (paracetamol).
10.	Bruising of the face after delivery:
	-	Is an important sign of brain haemorrhage.
	-	Is an indication for urgent transferral to a hospital.
	-	Is usually caused by haemorrhagic disease.
	+	Is commonly caused by an umbilical cord wound tightly around the neck.
11.	Thrombocytopaenia means:
	+	Too few platelets in the blood
	-	Too many platelets in the blood
	-	A normal number but abnormal function of platelets in the blood
	-	A decreased amount of clotting factors in the blood
12.	A decreased number of platelets in the blood may be caused by:
	-	Hypoglycaemia
	-	Preterm delivery
	+	Septicaemia
	-	Jaundice
13.	Antibodies can cross the placenta from the mother to the fetus and result in:
	+	A low platelet count
	-	An increased platelet count
	-	A decreased level of clotting factors
	-	An increased level of clotting factors
14.	Which drug can cross the placenta and cause bleeding in the infant at birth by decreasing the clotting factors?
	-	Paracetamol (Panado)
	-	Heparin
	+	Warfarin
	-	Penicillin
15.	Disseminated intravascular coagulo­pathy (DIC) causes bleeding due to:
	-	A decreased production of clotting factors
	+	An increased consumption (using up) of clotting factors
	-	A decreased production of platelets
	-	Leaking blood vessels
16.	Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn is caused by lack of:
	-	Vitamin A
	-	Vitamin C
	-	Vitamin E
	+	Vitamin K
17.	Konakion should be given at birth:
	-	Only to infants at high risk of bleeding
	-	Only to preterm infants
	-	Only to infants born in hospital
	+	To all infants
18.	Konakion should be injected into the infant’s:
	-	Buttock
	+	Lateral thigh
	-	Upper arm
	-	Scalp
19.	Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn usually presents with:
	+	Blood in the stool and vomitus
	-	Purpura
	-	Jaundice
	-	Cephalhaematoma
20.	Bleeding in haemophilia is due to:
	-	Decreased platelets
	+	Lack of clotting factor 8
	-	Fragile blood vessels
	-	Lack of vitamin K
