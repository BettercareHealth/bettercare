# Test 8: Glucose control and hypoglycaemia

1.	Glucose is stored in the body as glycogen in:
	-	The brain
	-	The red blood cells
	+	The liver
	-	Fat
2.	In the healthy newborn infant the blood glucose concentration is:
	+	Lower than a normal adult
	-	The same as a normal adult
	-	Higher than a normal adult
	-	Higher than a normal child
3.	The normal blood glucose concentration in a newborn infant is:
	-	Less than 2.0 mmol/l
	+	2.0 mmol/l to 7.0 mmol/l
	-	1.5 mmol/l to 10.0 mmol/l
	-	7.0 mmol/l to 15 mmol/l
4.	The definition of severe hypoglycaemia is a blood glucose concentration:
	-	Less than 7.0 mmol/l
	-	Less than 5.0 mmol/l
	-	Less than 2.0 mmol/l
	+	Less than 1.5 mmol/l
5.	Hypoglycaemia is dangerous as it may cause:
	-	Jaundice
	+	Brain damage
	-	Anaemia
	-	Bleeding
6.	Which of the following problems is likely to cause hypoglycaemia because the infant has an increased breakdown of glucose?
	+	A skin temperature below 36°C
	-	An intraventricular haemorrhage
	-	Jaundice
	-	Bruising
7.	The following infants are at high risk of hypoglycaemia as they have increased energy (glucose) requirements:
	-	Infants with recurrent apnoea
	-	Infants born after 37 weeks gestation
	+	Infants with respiratory distress
	-	Infants with jaundice
8.	Infants born to diabetic women are at risk of hypoglycaemia because they commonly have:
	+	Increased secretion of insulin
	-	Decreased secretion of insulin
	-	No secretion of insulin
	-	No pancreas
9.	The following infants are at an increased risk of hypoglycaemia:
	-	Female infants
	-	Male infants
	+	Wasted infants
	-	Term infants
10.	Hypoglycaemia:
	-	Always presents with clinical signs.
	-	Never presents with clinical signs.
	+	May present with clinical signs.
	-	Usually kills the infant.
11.	Hypoglycaemia may present with:
	-	Jaundice
	+	Convulsions
	-	Pyrexia
	-	Oedema
12.	What should be given as the first feed to a healthy, preterm infant of 1850g?
	-	Sterile water
	+	A milk feed
	-	A 5% glucose feed
	-	A 50% glucose feed
13.	To prevent hypoglycaemia you should routinely start feeding term infants:
	+	Immediately after delivery
	-	At 1 hour after delivery
	-	At 3 hours after delivery
	-	At 6 hours after delivery
14.	If a newborn infant had severe hypoglycaemia in a rural clinic with very limited facilities, which form of treatment should you give?
	-	Give a feed of 50% dextrose.
	+	Give a feed of cow’s milk and sugar if the mother has no breast milk.
	-	Not feed the infant but send the mother and infant to the nearest hospital for an intravenous infusion.
	-	Advise the mother to take the infant home.
15.	Severe hypoglycaemia in a preterm infant is best treated by:
	-	Feeding the infant with breast milk
	-	Giving 5% dextrose by nasogastric tube
	-	Giving an intravenous bolus of 25% dextrose
	+	Starting an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose
16.	In hospital you are unable to find a suitable vein to start an intravenous infusion in a 4000?g infant of a diabetic woman. The infant has severe hypoglycaemia. Would you:
	+	Pass an umbilical vein catheter and start a 10% dextrose solution?
	-	Give a 5% dextrose feed?
	-	Cool the infant to conserve energy?
	-	Start antibiotics?
17.	If an infant develops severe hypoglycaemia you should:
	-	Repeat the blood glucose measurement in 30 minutes to assess whether it has improved.
	+	Treat the hypoglycaemia immediately.
	-	Refer the infant to the nearest newborn intensive care (level 3) unit.
	-	Try to contact a more senior staff member to treat the infant.
18.	In an infant being treated for severe hypoglycaemia, when should regular blood glucose concentration measurements with reagent strips be stopped?
	-	Once the intravenous dextrose infusion is started
	-	As soon as the blood glucose concentration returns to normal
	-	Only after 5 days
	+	When the infant has been weaned from intravenous dextrose to milk feeds
19.	A very high blood glucose concentration:
	-	Helps the infant to grow rapidly.
	+	Causes glycosuria which may result in the infant becoming dehydrated.
	-	Is common in newborn infants of diabetic mothers.
	-	Is caused by feeding the infant too frequently.
20.	Hyperglycaemia as a complication of an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose or Neonatalyte is usually seen in:
	-	Wasted infants
	+	Preterm infants
	-	Postterm infants
	-	Infected infants
