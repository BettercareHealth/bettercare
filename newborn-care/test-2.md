## Test 2: Assessing gestational age and size at birth

1.	Gestation is measured from:
	-	The day of conception
	-	The day the mother first feels fetal movement
	+	The first day of the mother’s last normal menstrual period
	-	The day of the mother’s first developed symptoms of pregnancy
2.	What is the average gestational age at birth?
	-	37 weeks
	-	38 weeks
	+	40 weeks
	-	42 weeks
3.	An infant with a gestational age of 37 weeks is called:
	+	Term
	-	Preterm
	-	Postterm
	-	Low birth weight
4.	A preterm infant is defined as an infant with a gestational age:
	-	Less than 35 weeks
	-	Less than 36 weeks
	+	Less than 37 weeks
	-	Less than 38 weeks
5.	Postterm infants have a gestational age of:
	+	42 weeks or more
	-	41 weeks or more
	-	40 weeks or more
	-	38 weeks or more
6.	The gestational age can be estimated after delivery by:
	-	Weighing the infant
	-	Measuring the infant’s head circumference
	-	Measuring the infant’s haemoglobin concentration
	+	Examining the infant’s physical features and assessing the neurological behaviour
7.	Infants that are born preterm have an increased incidence of:
	-	Meconium aspiration syndrome
	-	Wasting
	+	Hypothermia
	-	Pyrexia
8.	Which of the following infants should have their weight measured after delivery?
	-	Infants that appear to be preterm
	-	Infants that are wasted
	-	Infants that appear clinically ill
	+	All infants
9.	Postterm infants are at an increased risk of:
	-	Hyaline membrane disease
	-	Anaemia
	-	Feeding difficulties
	+	Birth trauma
10.	Most newborn infants weigh between:
	-	2000 g and 2500 g
	+	2500 g and 4000 g
	-	3500 g and 4000 g
	-	4000 g and 4500 g
11.	Low birth weight infants weigh:
	-	Less than 3000 g
	+	Less than 2500 g
	-	Less than 2000 g
	-	Less than 1500 g
12.	Most infants have a birth weight that falls:
	-	Above the 90th centile
	+	Between the 10th and 90th centiles
	-	Below the 10th centile
	-	Below the 3rd centile
13.	Infants that are underweight for gestational age have a birth weight that falls:
	-	Below the 90th centile
	-	Between the 10th and 90th centiles
	+	Below the 10th centile
	-	Below the 3rd centile
14.	Overweight for gestational age infants are often born to mothers with:
	-	Hypertension
	-	Syphilis
	-	Rubella
	+	Diabetes
15.	Intra-uterine growth restriction usually results in:
	-	Only weight below the 10th centile at birth
	+	Both weight and head circumference below the 10th centile at birth
	-	Only head circumference below the 10th centile
	-	Postterm delivery
16.	Wasting in the newborn infant is usually the result of:
	-	Infection
	+	Fetal undernutrition in the last weeks of pregnancy
	-	Preterm delivery
	-	Maternal diabetes
17.	Loose, wrinkled, dry skin and loss of muscle in an infant at birth suggests:
	+	Wasting
	-	Preterm delivery
	-	Rhesus disease
	-	Septicaemia
18.	Infants that are wasted at birth:
	-	Are usually overweight for gestational age
	-	Are always postterm
	+	May be appropriate for gestational age at term
	-	Are always low birth weight
19.	Wasted infants are at an increased risk of:
	+	Hypoglycaemia
	-	Birth trauma
	-	Hyaline membrane disease
	-	Infection
20.	Which of the following is the best predictor of problems in the neonatal period?
	-	Gestational age alone
	-	Weight alone
	-	Weight for gestational age
	+	Gestational age together with weight for gestational age
