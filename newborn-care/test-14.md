	-	By inspecting the infant for a mass in the groin
	-	By performing an Apt test on all infants before discharge
	+	By doing a Barlowâ€™s test on all infants after delivery
6.	How should you manage an infant with a dislocated hip?
	-	Nurse the infant in double nappies.
	+	Refer the infant as soon as possible to an orthopaedic clinic for splinting.
	-	Examine the infant again in 2 weeks to determine whether the hip has returned to normal.
	-	Strap the hip to prevent pain.
7.	An undescended testis in a term infant:

	-	Is usually seen in girls.
11.	Infants that appear normal but have a single umbilical artery:
	-	Have Down syndrome.
	+	Should be carefully examined for other abnormalities.
	-	Can be discharged as these are common minor abnormalities that cause no problem.
	-	Should be referred urgently to a genetics clinic for chromosome analysis.
12.	How should infants with a cleft lip be managed?
	+	These infants should be referred to a plastic surgeon.
	-	The cleft lip can be stitched closed at 6?months by a medical officer at a level 2 hospital.

	+	Duodenal atresia
	-	An absent anus
	-	Meningomyelocoele
16.	What is the immediate management of a meningomyelocoele?
	+	Cover it with sterile gauze.
