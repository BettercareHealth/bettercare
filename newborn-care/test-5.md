## Test 5: Care of high-risk and sick infants

1.	Classifying an infant as high risk indicates that:
	-	The infant is sick.
	-	The infant will probably die.
	+	The infant has a greater chance of developing a problem than most infants.
	-	The infant must be treated urgently.
2.	Which event suggests that an infant should be classified as high risk?
	-	Term delivery
	+	Low birth weight
	-	An Apgar score of 8 at 1 minute
	-	A birth weight that is appropriate for the gestational age
3.	What is the first step in the management of a high-risk infant?
	-	Treat the clinical problem as early as possible.
	-	Monitor the vital signs.
	+	Identify the expected problem.
	-	Take steps to prevent the problem.
4.	Why is it important to monitor a high-risk infant?
	-	To obtain hospital records
	-	To reassure the parents
	+	To detect problems
	-	To treat the infant
5.	Which of the following signs indicates that the infant is sick?
	-	Preterm delivery
	-	Birth weight of 1500 g
	-	Delivery by Caesarean section
	+	Apnoea
6.	Which of the following is called a vital sign?
	-	Birth weight
	-	Jaundice
	+	Heart rate
	-	Oedema
7.	A sick infant should be handled as little as possible because:
	+	Excessive handling may cause apnoea.
	-	Handling slows an infant’s weight gain.
	-	Handling may cause bruising.
	-	Handling increases the risk of bacterial infection.
8.	Sick infants should be weighed every day because:
	+	Weight loss may indicate dehydration.
	-	Weight loss may indicate that the infant is bleeding into the brain.
	-	Weight gain indicates that treatment can be stopped.
	-	Weight gain indicates that the infant is well.
9.	How often should routine observations be made on a sick infant?
	-	Every 5 minutes
	-	Every 15 minutes
	+	Every 30 minutes
	-	Every 60 minutes
10.	An important sign of shock in a newborn infant is:
	+	A low blood pressure
	-	Sweating
	-	Central cyanosis
	-	Hypothermia
11.	What is a normal capillary filling time?
	-	1 second or less
	+	3 seconds or less
	-	5 seconds or less
	-	More than 5 seconds
12.	An important cause of shock in newborn infants is:
	-	Hypothermia
	-	Anaemia
	+	Hypoxia
	-	Hyperbilirubinaemia
13.	Which of the following fluids should be used to treat shock?
	-	5% dextrose
	-	10% dextrose
	-	Neonatalyte
	+	Normal saline
14.	An important cause of fits in newborn infants is:
	+	Hypoglycaemia
	-	Hypothermia
	-	Preterm delivery
	-	Cephalhaematoma
15.	Which drug should be used to stop a fit?
	-	Penicillin
	-	Pethidine
	+	Phenobarbitone
	-	Hydroxyzine (Aterax)
16.	The pH of the blood is measured with:
	-	Indicator strips
	-	A thermometer
	-	A pulse oximeter in the nursery
	+	A blood gas analyser in a laboratory
17.	The umbilical arterial pH of the blood in a newborn infant is:
	-	7.20–7.30
	+	7.30–7.40
	-	7.40–7.50
	-	7.50–7.60
18.	What measurement suggests that a low pH is caused by a metabolic acidosis?
	-	High PaCO₂
	-	Normal PaCO₂
	+	Base deficit greater than 5
	-	Base deficit less than 5
19.	What is used to correct severe metabolic acidosis?
	-	Phototherapy
	+	4% sodium bicarbonate
	-	Improved ventilation
	-	10% glucose
20.	The correct management of respiratory acidosis is:
	-	Observe the infant with an apnoea monitor.
	-	Give the infant oxygen in a headbox.
	-	Give the infant 4% sodium bicarbonate by intravenous infusion.
	+	Ventilate the infant.
