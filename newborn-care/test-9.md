## Test 9: Jaundice, anaemia and polycythaemia

1.	What is the definition of jaundice?
	-	An increase in the concentration of bilirubin in the serum.
	+	The yellow discolouration of the skin and sclera due to deposits of bilirubin.
	-	A general feeling of nausea and lethargy.
	-	Yellow skin due to eating carrots.
2.	Bilirubin is formed by the breakdown of:
	+	Haemoglobin
	-	Bile
	-	Stercobilin
	-	Proteins
3.	What is the normal total serum bilirubin concentration (TSB) in cord blood?
	-	0 µmol/l
	+	Less than 35 µmol/l
	-	35–55 µmol/l
	-	More than 55 µmol/l
4.	Before bilirubin can be excreted by the newborn infant it must first be: 
	-	Oxidised in the kidney
	-	Haemolysed in the blood stream
	+	Conjugated in the liver
	-	Digested in the gut
5.	Jaundice lasting more than 3 weeks after delivery may be caused by:
	+	Hypothyroidism
	-	Hyperthyroidism
	-	Hypoglycaemia
	-	Anaemia
6.	Jaundice is commonest in:
	+	Preterm infants
	-	Term infants
	-	Postterm infants
	-	Underweight for gestational age infants
7.	Hepatitis commonly presents with obstructive jaundice and:
	-	Dark stools
	+	Pale stools
	-	Blood-stained stools
	-	Blood in the urine
8.	Jaundice between day 2 and 7 is:
	-	Always abnormal
	-	Usually a sign of haemolytic disease
	-	Always treated with phototherapy
	+	Common in normal, healthy infants
9.	Haemolytic disease of the newborn is caused by:
	-	Lack of vitamin K
	-	Bacteria crossing the placenta from the mother to the fetus
	-	A cephalhaematoma or bruising
	+	Damage to fetal red blood cells caused by maternal antibodies
10.	ABO haemolytic disease is likely in the following combination of blood groups:
	-	The mother is A and the infant is B.
	-	The mother is A and the infant is O.
	+	The mother is O and the infant is A.
	-	The mother is O and the infant is O.
11.	A positive Coomb’s test in the cord blood is found in:
	-	Hepatitis
	-	Physiological jaundice
	+	ABO incompatibility
	-	Jaundice of immaturity
12.	Hydrops (generalised oedema of the newborn) is common in:
	-	ABO haemolytic disease
	+	Rhesus haemolytic disease
	-	Biliary atresia
	-	Jaundice of immaturity
13.	Anti-D immunoglobulin should be given after delivery, miscarriage or antepartum haemorrhage to:
	-	All women
	-	All women who have had a previous infant with Rhesus haemolytic disease
	-	All Rhesus-positive women
	+	All Rhesus-negative women
14.	In Rhesus haemolytic disease the mothers blood group may be:
	+	O –ve
	-	O +ve
	-	A +ve
	-	B +ve
15.	Rhesus haemolytic disease must be suspected if:
	+	An infant is jaundiced in the first 24 hours of life.
	-	An infant has an elevated haemoglobin.
	-	The Coomb’s test on the cord blood is negative.
	-	The infant is a male.
16.	Bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus) causes:
	-	Liver failure
	-	Green staining of the skin called bronzing
	+	Mental retardation
	-	No clinical problems
17.	Phototherapy acts by:
	+	Making unconjugated bilirubin water soluble
	-	Conjugating bilirubin
	-	Stimulating the liver
	-	Changing bilirubin to stercobilin
18.	During phototherapy the serum bilirubin concentration is lowered by exposing the infant to:
	-	Ultraviolet light
	+	Visible light
	-	Infrared light
	-	Heat
19.	What treatment should be given to an infant if the total serum bilirubin concentration is above 400 µmol/l?
	-	Phototherapy alone
	+	Exchange transfusion
	-	Oral phenobarbitone
	-	Frequent feeds
20.	What is the normal range of packed cell volume (PCV) at birth?
	-	10–25%
	-	25–45%
	+	45–65%
	-	65–75%
