## Test 1: Failure to breathe at birth and resuscitation

1.	How many infants breathe well at birth?
	-	50%
	-	75%
	-	80%
	+	90%
2.	Which vital sign is included in the Apgar score?
	-	Temperature
	+	Heart rate
	-	Meconium staining
	-	Oedema
3.	Most newborn infants that breathe well after delivery should have:
	-	Pink hands at birth
	-	Pink feet at birth
	-	Pink hands and feet by 1 minute
	+	A pink tongue by 1 minute
4.	A normal Apgar score at 1 minute is:
	-	Above 10
	+	7–10
	-	3–7
	-	Less than 3
5.	The Apgar score at 1 minute should be determined: 
	+	In all newborn infants
	-	Only when there have been signs of fetal distress
	-	Only if the infant does not breathe well after birth
	-	Only if the infant needs mask ventilation
6.	What is the value of the 1 minute Apgar score?
	-	It predicts brain damage.
	-	It confirms fetal hypoxia.
	+	It is used to assess the infant’s clinical condition at birth.
	-	It is used to assess gestational age.
7.	What is the value of a 5 minute Apgar score?
	-	It is used to define ‘failure to breathe at birth’.
	+	It is used to assess the success or failure of resuscitation.
	-	It helps to decide whether further resuscitation is hopeless.
	-	It accurately predicts whether the infant will develop cerebral palsy.
8.	In which of the following situations would you anticipate that the infant will need resuscitation at birth?
	+	Caesarean section under general anaesthesia
	-	Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia
	-	Mother had pethidine 8 hours before delivery
	-	Mother received nitrous oxide during the second stage of labour
9.	All the equipment for basic resuscitation is needed:
	-	In operating theatres only
	-	In level 2 hospitals only
	-	In level 3 hospitals only
	+	In all hospitals and clinics where infants are delivered
10.	If an infant does not breathe immediately after birth, what do you do first?
	+	Stimulate the infant by drying.
	-	Start chest compressions.
	-	Cool the infant.
	-	Give naloxone by intramuscular injection.
11.	Which staff members need to be able to resuscitate infants:
	-	Doctors only
	-	Midwives only
	-	Doctors and senior midwives only
	+	All staff who conduct deliveries
12.	After being well dried which infants should have their mouth and pharynx suctioned:
	-	Preterm infants
	-	Infants born by Caesarean section
	+	Infants that fail to breathe well
	-	All newborn infants
13.	Which infants should be resuscitated with oxygen?
	+	Infants who fail to respond to good bag and mask ventilation
	-	Preterm infants
	-	Meconium stained infants
	-	All infants
14.	An infant who cannot be adequately ventilated with bag and mask should: 
	+	Be intubated and ventilated.
	-	Be given chest compressions.
	-	Be given adrenaline.
	-	Receive no further resuscitation as it has probably suffered brain damage.
15.	Which of the following rates is recommended for ventilating a newborn infant?
	-	20 breaths per minute
	+	40 breaths per minute
	-	80 breaths per minute
	-	140 breaths per minute
16.	Naloxone reverses the respiratory depression caused by:
	-	Barbiturates
	-	General anaesthesia
	-	Diazepam (Valium)
	+	Pethidine and morphine
17.	The infant’s chance of survival is poor if:
	-	The 1 minute Apgar score is low.
	-	The 5 minute Apgar score is low.
	+	The 20 minute Apgar score is low.
	-	The infant needs to be intubated and ventilated.
18.	If an infant is heavily meconium stained at delivery:
	-	It is important to stimulate respiration before suctioning the airways.
	+	The mouth should be suctioned before the shoulders are delivered.
	-	The mouth should only be suctioned after the infant is completely delivered.
	-	Only the nose should be suctioned.
19.	Which size of catheter should be used to suction a meconium-stained infant at birth?
	-	F 3.5
	-	F 5
	-	F 6
	+	F 10
20.	Severe hypoxia before delivery causing fetal distress:
	-	Will always result in stillbirth or neonatal death.
	+	May cause transient or permanent brain damage.
	-	Does not damage the heart and kidneys.
	-	Is an indication not to resuscitate the infant at birth.
