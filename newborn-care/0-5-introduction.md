## About the Bettercare series

Bettercare in an independent, registered Non-Profit and Public Benefit Organisation. Our aim is to create accessible educational resources that improve the quality of healthcare in even the most challenging circumstances.

Bettercare learning courses ensure that all healthcare professionals have access to high-quality, affordable and up-to-date training in every facility, regardless of its history, resources or geographical location. Additions and changes are informed by ongoing feedback from healthcare workers, educators and participants; findings on new and better methods of diagnosing and treating patients and the latest developments in child, perinatal and HIV care.

Bettercare learning courses grew out of the ongoing work of the Perinatal Education Programme (PEP). PEP began in 1989 when a small team of paediatricians, obstetricians and nurses came together to develop a consensus document on best practice care for mothers and infants. The PEP method of self-directed, decentralised learning has been tested in controlled studies and proven to improve knowledge, attitudes, skills and patient care practices in health professionals.

## Why decentralised learning? 

Continuing education for health professionals traditionally consists of courses and workshops run by formal trainers at large central hospitals. These courses are expensive, often far away from the health professionalsâ€™ families and places of work, and the content frequently fails to address the biggest healthcare challenges of poor, rural communities.

PEP developed the self-help, decentralised learning method in response to these problems and to address the needs of all professional healthcare workers, especially those in under-resourced regions. Working closely with PEP, all Bettercare learning courses follow this basic, proven learning methodology.

A learning course is the curriculum and study material you need to run a course, all in one book. Whether you lead a study group or manage formal training, Bettercare learning courses make your job simpler and easier. We provide the learning material, you run the course. You can implement Bettercare learning courses in your institution right now. There is no need to wait for acceptance to a centralised training programme.

Each chapter of a Bettercare learning course contains the most relevant and up-to-date information health professionals rely on to provide excellent and appropriate care to their patients. Learning material is presented in a question-and-answer format. Each chapter has a multiple-choice quiz consisting of 20 questions. Users do the quiz beforehand then study a chapter to identify gaps in knowledge. Afterwards they can redo the quiz to gauge their learning at the end of each chapter.

Participants study one chapter at a time on their own and then meet colleagues to discuss what they have learned. The formation of study groups encourages co-operative learning where colleagues share their knowledge and understanding. While the role of a facilitator can be useful, a formal teacher is not needed.

Bettercare learning courses have helped thousands of nurses, midwives, doctors and students increase their knowledge, boost their confidence, and improve patient care.

## Bettercare Online Learning Station

The Bettercare Learning Station is a free, simple website that can be used on tablets, computers or phones. The material on the Learning Station is always the most up-to-date, and includes all the learning courses full content and the multiple-choice quizzes for each chapter.

Students using Bettercare books can benefit from video clips addressing diagnosis and management which are attached to some of the chapters on the website.

By registering on the Learning Station, students can also complete the multiple-choice chapter quizzes. Registering is free, quick and only requires a cellphone number or email address and a password. On completing each quiz, users receive their results and advice on where they may have gone wrong.

This methodology allows users control over their studies without feeling as though they are being watched. The Bettercare Learning Station privacy policy includes the clause that only information which users have agreed to make available may be used to generate reports.

You can access the learning station here: ls.bettercare.co.za

Chapters cover virology and epidemiology, patient management, support systems and documentation and communication and community engagement. There is a strong emphasis on the protection of healthcare workers in the field, particularly in resource-limited settings.

### Fetal Heart Rate Monitor Handbook

One of the most dangerous times of our life is the few hours when our mother is in labour. Monitoring the fetal heart rate is the best method of assessing fetal wellbeing in primary care facilities. However appropriate technology to monitor the fetal heart rate in labour is often not available in many labour wards though it is vital to prevent brain damage. The *Fetal Heart Rate Monitor Handbook* teaches the basics of oxygen transfer from mother to fetus and how to monitor the fetus in labour with a fetal stethoscope or fetal monitor to recognise inadequate oxygenation.

### Infection Prevention and Control

*Infection Prevention and Control* was written for nurses, doctors, and health administrators working in the field of infection prevention and control, particularly in resource-limited settings. It includes chapters on infection prevention and control programmes, risk management, health facility design, outbreak surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship. The book is supported by the Academic Unit for Infection Prevention and Control (UIPC) at Tygerberg Academic Hospital.

### Intrapartum Care

*Intrapartum Care* was developed for doctors and advanced midwives who care for women who deliver in level 2 hospitals. It contains theory and skills chapters adapted from the labour chapters of *Maternal Care*. Particular attention is given to the care of the mother, the management of labour and monitoring the wellbeing of the fetus. *Intrapartum Care* was written to support and complement the national protocol of intrapartum care and the essential steps to manage obstetric emergencies (ESMOE) in South Africa.

### Maternal Care

*Maternal Care* addresses all the common and important problems that occur during pregnancy, labour, delivery and the puerperium. It covers the antenatal and postnatal care of healthy women with normal pregnancies, monitoring and managing the progress of labour, specific medical problems during pregnancy, labour and the puerperium, family planning and regionalised perinatal care. Skills chapters teach clinical examination in pregnancy and labour, routine screening tests, the use of an antenatal card and partogram, measuring blood pressure, detecting proteinuria and performing and repairing an episiotomy. *Maternal Care* is aimed at health workers in level 1 hospitals or clinics.

It includes an introduction to maternal mental health and illness, making referrals for maternal mental illness, helping mothers with mental health problems and special issues in maternal mental health. It includes a resource section for assessing, referring and supporting mothers in the perinatal period. The book is supported by The Perinatal Mental Health Project of the Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health at the University of Cape Town.

### Mother and Baby Care for Community Health Workers

Community Health Workers (CHWs) serve as a direct link between patients, communities and health services. As trusted on-the-ground support to community members, they expand access to essential healthcare information as well as available treatment and prevention programmes. *Mother and Baby Care for Community Health Workers* includes modules that have been successfully used as part of the Skills to Care learning programme for the Lukhanji Municipality and Sarah Baartman District Municipality in the Eastern Cape.

### Mother and Baby Friendly Care

*Mother and Baby Friendly Care* describes gentler, kinder, evidence-based ways of caring for women during pregnancy, labour and delivery. It also presents improved methods of providing infant care with an emphasis on kangaroo mother care and exclusive breastfeeding.

It covers resuscitation at birth, assessing infant size and gestational age, routine care and feeding of both normal and high-risk infants, the prevention, diagnosis and management of hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, jaundice, respiratory distress, infection, trauma, bleeding and congenital abnormalities, as well as communication with parents. Skills chapters address resuscitation, size measurement, history, examination and clinical notes, nasogastric feeds, intravenous infusions, use of incubators, measuring blood glucose concentration, insertion of an umbilical vein catheter, phototherapy, apnoea monitors and oxygen therapy.

### Perinatal HIV

*Perinatal HIV* enables midwives, nurses and doctors to care for pregnant women and their infants in communities where HIV infection is common. Special emphasis has been placed on the prevention of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV. It covers the basics of HIV infection and screening, antenatal and intrapartum care of women with HIV infection, care of HIV-exposed newborn infants, and parent counselling.

### Primary Maternal Care

*Primary Maternal Care* addresses the needs of health workers who provide antenatal and postnatal care, but do not conduct deliveries. It is adapted from theory and skills chapters from *Maternal Care*. This book is ideal for midwives and doctors providing primary maternal care in level 1 district hospitals and clinics, and complements the national protocol of antenatal care in South Africa.

### Primary Newborn Care

*Primary Newborn Care* was written specifically for nurses and doctors who provide primary care for newborn infants in level 1 clinics and hospitals. *Primary Newborn Care* addresses the care of infants at birth, care of normal infants, care of low-birth-weight infants, neonatal emergencies, and common minor problems in newborn infants.

### Saving Mothers and Babies

*Saving Mothers and Babies* was developed in response to the high maternal and perinatal mortality rates found in most developing countries. Learning material used in this book is based on the results of the annual confidential enquiries into maternal deaths and the Saving Mothers and Saving Babies reports published in South Africa. It addresses the basic principles of mortality audit, maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, managing mortality meetings and ways of reducing maternal and perinatal mortality rates. This book should be used together with the Perinatal Problem Identification Programme (PPIP).

### Well Women

*Well Women* was written for primary health workers who manage the everyday health needs of women. It covers reproductive health, family planning and infertility, common genital infections, vaginal bleeding, and the abuse of women.

## Format of the courses

### Objectives

The learning objectives are clearly stated at the start of each chapter. They help the participant to identify and understand the important lessons to be learned.

### Pre- and post-quizzes

There is a multiple-choice quiz of 20 questions for each chapter at the end of the book. Participants are encouraged to take a pre-quiz before starting each chapter, to benchmark their current knowledge, and a post-quiz after each chapter, to assess what they have learned. Participants are provided with the correct answers so that they can mark their quizzes.  Self-assessment allows participants to monitor their own progress through the course.

### Question-and-answer format

Theoretical knowledge is presented in a question-and-answer format, which encourages the learner to actively participate in the learning process. In this way, the participant is led step by step through the definitions, causes, diagnosis, prevention, dangers and management of a particular problem.

Participants should cover the answer for a few minutes with a piece of paper while thinking about the correct reply to each question. This method helps learning.

Simplified flow diagrams are also used, where necessary, to indicate the correct approach to diagnosing or managing a particular problem.
Each question is identified with the number of the chapter, followed by the number of the question, e.g. 5-23.

> Important practical lessons are emphasised like this.

Note
:   Additional, non-essential information is provided for interest and given in notes like this. These facts are not used in the case studies or included in the multiple-choice quizzes.

### Case studies

Each chapter closes with a few case studies which encourage the participant to consolidate and apply what was learned in the chapter. These studies give the participant an opportunity to see the problem as it usually presents itself in the clinic or hospital and integrate their new theoretical knowledge into practice. The participant should attempt to answer each question in the case study before reading the correct answer.

### Practical skills

Some Bettercare books include workshops on practical skills that need to be practised, preferably in groups. These skills workshops list essential equipment and present step-by-step instructions on how to perform each task, often with pictures. If participants are not familiar with a practical skill, they should ask an appropriate medical or nursing colleague to demonstrate the clinical skill to them. In this way, senior personnel are encouraged to share their skills with their colleagues. Some of the skills are demonstrated in video clips on the Learning Station.

### Bettercare quizzes and examinations

Self-evaluation is the most important part of learning. For every chapter, participants take a short self-quiz before and after studying each chapter. This way participants can see their knowledge improve and can address specific weaknesses.

Quizzes are included in all our printed books and ebooks. Participants can take them for free on our Learning Station.

Bettercare also offers a final examination for each course. Participants need to achieve at least 80% in the final examination to receive a digital certificate stating that they have successfully completed the learning course.


## Contributors

The developers of our learning materials are a multi-disciplinary team of nurses, midwives, obstetricians, neonatologists, general paediatricians and other medical specialists. The development and review of all course material is overseen our Editor-in-Chief, emeritus Professor David Woods, a previous head of neonatal medicine at the University of Cape Town who consulted to UNICEF and the WHO.

### Perinatal Education Trust

The Perinatal Education Trust (PET) is a non-profit organisation which aims to improve the care of pregnant women and their newborn infants, especially in poor, rural communities. The Perinatal Education Trust produces and distributes all Perinatal Education Programme (PEP) material.

PEP presents a unique form of self-help training for health professionals which places the responsibility for continuing education on the participants themselves. It is cheap, appropriate, practical and does not require a teacher. Since 1989 over 100 000 health workers have used PEP course books in South Africa.

### Breast Course for Nurses

The Breast Course for Nurses (BCN) combines distance education with a residential course. The emphasis is on learning rather than teaching. The Breast Course for Nurses can be adapted to suit the needs of the healthcare providers being trained.

### Academic Unit for Infection Prevention and Control at Stellenbosch University

The Academic Unit for Infection Prevention and Control (UIPC) is based at Tygerberg Academic Hospital and the Stellenbosch University Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (FHMS). It resides under the Division of Community Health and is also a member of the Centre for Infectious Diseases.

The UIPC focuses on integrated research, training and service provision. The unit offers a range of tailor-made courses in Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) as well as decontamination and sterilisation for Sterile Service Departments (SSDs). In addition, courses are offered for specialities such as operating theatres, renal dialysis units, intensive care units and infectious disease management and control.

### Eduhealthcare

Eduhealthcare is a non-profit organisation based in South Africa. It aims to improve health and wellbeing, especially in poor communities, through affordable education for healthcare workers. To this end it provides financial support for the development and publishing of the Bettercare series.

### The Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation

The Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation at the University of Cape Town is a centre of excellence in HIV medicine, building capacity through training and enhancing knowledge through research.

### The Desmond Tutu Tuberculosis Centre

The Desmond Tutu Tuberculosis Centre at Stellenbosch University strives to improve the health of vulnerable groups through the education of healthcare workers and community members, and by influencing policy based on research into the epidemiology of childhood tuberculosis, multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, HIV and TB co-infection, and preventing the spread of TB and HIV in southern Africa.

### Perinatal Mental Health Project

The Perinatal Mental Health Project of the Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health at the University of Cape Town aims at improving the mental health of women both during pregnancy and in the months afterwards. The project targets women who are at risk of depression and anxiety.

### The Infection Control Africa Network

The Infection Control Africa Network (ICAN) promotes and facilitates the establishment of infection control programmes. This includes promotion of surveillance for and reduction of healthcare-associated infections, and antimicrobial stewardship activities through education. ICAN works with infection prevention structures in Africa and other international health-related associations.

## Updating the course material

Bettercare learning programmes are regularly updated to keep up with developments and changes in healthcare protocols. Course participants can make important contributions to the continual improvement of Bettercare books by reporting factual or language errors, by identifying sections that are difficult to understand, and by suggesting additions or improvements to the contents. Details of alternative or better forms of management would be particularly appreciated. Please send any comments or suggestions to the Editor-in-Chief, Professor David Woods.
