## Test 10: Respiratory distress and apnoea

1.	Which one of the following clinical signs is used to diagnose respiratory distress?
	-	Pallor
	-	Decreased air entry of the chest
	+	Recession
	-	Pyrexia
2.	Tachypnoea is defined as a respiratory rate equal or greater than:
	-	20 breaths per minute
	-	40 breaths per minute
	+	60 breaths per minute
	-	80 breaths per minute
3.	Grunting is an important sign of respiratory distress and is heard during:
	-	Inspiration
	-	Crying
	-	Apnoea
	+	Expiration
4.	Infants with hyaline membrane disease should be:
	-	Handled frequently to prevent apnoea
	+	Handled as little as possible
	-	Suctioned every hour
	-	Given antibiotics
5.	Hyaline membrane disease is caused by:
	+	Lack of surfactant
	-	Too much surfactant
	-	Infection
	-	Too much fluid in the lungs
6.	A diagnosis of hyaline membrane disease is likely with:
	-	Pus cells and bacteria in the gastric aspirate at birth
	-	A positive VDRL test
	-	A chest X-ray showing hyperexpanded lungs
	+	A chest X-ray showing a small lungs with granular lung fields
7.	Hyaline membrane disease is commonly seen in:
	-	Meconium-stained infants
	+	Preterm infants
	-	Underweight for gestational age infants
	-	Postterm infants
8.	Hyaline membrane disease can be expected to:
	-	Improve steadily after birth
	-	Steadily become worse after birth for about 6 hours then improve
	+	Steadily become worse after birth for 48 to 72 hours before starting to improve
	-	Only start to recover after 1 week
9.	Where should an infant with hyaline membrane disease be managed?
	-	In the postnatal ward with its mother
	-	In a clinic
	-	In a level 1 hospital
	+	In a level 2 or 3 hospital
10.	The commonest cause of respiratory distress is:
	-	Hyaline membrane disease
	-	Hypothermia
	+	Wet lung syndrome
	-	Meconium aspiration
11.	The wet lung syndrome:
	+	Improves during the first 2 to 3 days.
	-	Gradually gets worse after delivery.
	-	Should be treated with antibiotics.
	-	Is usually fatal.
12.	A hyperinflated chest in an infant with respiratory distress suggests a diagnosis of:
	+	Meconium aspiration syndrome
	-	Hyaline membrane disease
	-	Patent ductus arteriosus
	-	Pneumonia
13.	Meconium aspiration syndrome can be prevented by:
	-	Suctioning the airways after the infant has started to breathe
	+	Suctioning the airways before the infant starts to breathe
	-	Giving the infant steroids
	-	Washing out the stomach
14.	Which is a quick way of diagnosing pneumothorax?
	+	Transilluminate the chest.
	-	Take an X-ray of the abdomen.
	-	Insert a chest drain.
	-	Do a shake test on the gastric aspirate at birth.
15.	What is a common cause of heart failure in newborn infants?
	- Dehydration
	+ Patent ductus arteriosus
	- Mitral stenosis
	- Hyaline membrane disease
16. An offensive smell at birth in an infant with respiratory distress suggests a diagnosis of:
	-	Meconium aspiration syndrome
	+	Pneumonia
	-	Syphilis
	-	Tetanus
17.	Periodic breathing:
	-	Causes pallor.
	-	Causes tachycardia.
	-	Causes bradycardia and central cyanosis.
	+	Causes neither central cyanosis nor bradycardia.
18.	Apnoea is diagnosed when:
	-	An infant stops breathing for 5 seconds.
	-	An infant stops breathing for 15 seconds but remains pink. 
	-	An infant becomes cyanosed but does not stop breathing.
	+	An infant stops breathing for 20 seconds and develops cyanosis and bradycardia.
19.	Apnoea is common in:
	+	Infants with septicaemia
	-	Underweight for gestational age infants
	-	Overweight for gestational age infants
	-	Postterm infants
20. How is caffeine given to prevent apnoea?
	+ Orally
	- By intramuscular injection
	- Intravenously
	- It is rubbed onto the infantâ€™s chest
