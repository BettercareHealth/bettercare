# Test 7: Temperature control and hypothermia

1.	The body temperature of a newborn infant should be measured by placing a digital thermometer:
	-	In the mouth
	-	In the rectum
	+	In the axilla (arm pit)
	-	In the incubator
2.	The normal abdominal skin temperature in a newborn infant is:
	-	35.5–36.0°C
	+	36.0–36.5°C
	-	36.5–37.0°C
	-	37.0–37.5°C
3.	Newborn infants produce heat by:
	-	Shivering
	-	Kicking their legs
	-	Sweating
	+	Breaking down brown fat
4.	Heat production is poor in:
	+	Preterm infants
	-	Term infants
	-	Postterm infants
	-	Female infants
5.	Loss of heat to the surrounding air is called:
	-	Radiation
	-	Conduction
	+	Convection
	-	Evaporation
6.	The amount of heat lost by radiation is influenced by:
	-	The temperature of the incubator
	-	The temperature of the room air
	+	The temperature of the walls and windows
	-	The temperature of the doctor’s hands
7.	Wet infants lose heat by:
	-	Conduction
	-	Convection
	+	Evaporation
	-	Radiation
8.	Heat loss is excessive in infants born:
	+	Underweight for gestational age
	-	With an appropriate weight for gestational age
	-	Overweight for gestational age
	-	At term
9.	What type of subcutaneous fat prevents heat loss?
	-	Brown fat
	+	White fat
	-	Yellow fat
	-	Pink fat
10.	Hypothermia is defined as a skin temperature below:
	-	37°C
	+	36°C
	-	30°C
	-	25°C
11.	What determines the correct incubator temperature?
	+	The infant’s weight
	-	The infant’s sex
	-	The infant’s haemoglobin concentration
	-	The Apgar score
12.	When is the oxygen and energy requirements of an infant lowest?
	-	When the body temperature is above normal.
	+	When the body temperature is normal.
	-	When the body temperature is below normal.
	-	The oxygen and energy requirements are not influenced by body temperature.
13.	Heat loss by radiation is best prevented by:
	-	Woollen booties
	-	Woollen leggings
	-	A woollen jacket
	+	A woollen cap
14.	How should a well newborn infant with a gestational age of 35 weeks and weighing 1500 g be nursed?
	+	With the mother in the KMC position
	-	Under a radiant warmer
	-	In a cot (bassinet) in the general nursery
	-	In a special warmed room
15.	Which form of heat loss is reduced by a perspex heat shield? 
	-	Convection
	+	Radiation
	-	Evaporation
	-	Conduction
16.	Cold infants usually have:
	-	A blue tongue and blue feet
	-	A pink tongue and pink feet
	+	A pink tongue and blue feet
	-	A blue tongue and pink feet
17.	Sclerema presents as:
	-	Blue sclera
	-	Oedema of the scalp
	-	Oedema of the feet
	+	A woody feel to the skin
18.	Hypothermia causes:
	-	Anaemia
	-	Proteinuria
	-	Hyperglycaemia
	+	Hypoglycaemia
19.	While a cold infant is being warmed, it is important to give:
	-	Sedatives
	-	Antibiotics
	-	A diuretic
	+	Extra energy
20.	Pyrexia is dangerous as it may cause:
	-	Bleeding
	-	Jaundice
	+	Apnoea
	-	Acidosis
