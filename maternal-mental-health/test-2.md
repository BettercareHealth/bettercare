	-	Make sure the woman is physically well
	-	Make sure that she is at least 28 weeks pregnant

11.	What is confidentiality?

	-	The tool has been used in other countries

	-	You automatically score 13 if you are feeling suicidal
	+	The higher the score per question, the more severe the symptom
16.	On the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), if a patient has a total score of 13 or more
	-	She is probably fine
	-	She has the international standard score
	+	She is probably experiencing depression or anxiety
	-	She only has problems with sleep – but this is usual for pregnant women
17.	If a woman has answered that she has thought of suicide on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) questionnaire, you should:
	-	Tell her to think about her baby
