# Test 1: History and examination

1.	What is the first step in the general examination of a child?
	+	Introduce yourself.
	-	Take a brief history.
	-	Do a physical examination.
	-	Get a chest X-ray.
2.	How should you address a child?
	-	Speak to the mother rather than to the child.
	-	It is best to call all children ‘kid’ so that you do not frighten them.
	+	Speak directly to the child using the child’s name.
	-	It is better if a nurse rather than a doctor speaks to the child.
3.	Is it important to listen to what mothers have to say?
	+	Yes, as the mother knows the child best.
	-	Yes, as the mother will be paying for the visit.
	-	No, as the mother expects you to tell her what the symptoms are.
	-	No, as mothers do not give an accurate history.
4.	What is the value of a referral letter?
	-	Of little value as the information is often incorrect.
	-	Only important if it was written by a doctor.
	-	Useful documentation to keep in the patient’s folder.
	+	Helpful in drawing your attention to the presenting problem.
5.	The Road-to-Health Card should be asked for:

	-	Only when the child is seen by a nurse.
	+	Always look at the Road-to-Health Card when a child attends any clinic or hospital.
6.	Knowing the child’s age is important because:

	+	An accurate age is needed to plot the child’s weight on the growth chart.
	-	Head circumference should be routinely measured in all children older than 2 years.
	-	Notes should be recorded in the Road-to-Health Card only in children younger than 2 years.
7.	How should you measure a child’s temperature?
	+	The axillary temperature is best in young children.
	-	The oral temperature should be recorded in all children.
	-	A rectal temperature is best in older children.

8.	Who should give the history?
	+	The child if possible.
	-	The mother or guardian.
	-	The referring doctor or nurse.
	-	The nurse should take the history from the mother and then tell the doctor the important points.
9.	An immunisation history is important:
	-	Only in children from a poor home.
	-	Only in children younger than 3 years.
	-	If the child attends a clinic but not needed for hospital admissions.
	+	Important for all children.
10.	A social history should be taken:
	-	Only if you suspect child abuse.
	+	Always, as the home situation is often the cause of the child’s problem.
	-	Always, as you need not examine the child if there is an obvious social problem.
	-	Only in children who are not able to give a history themselves.
11.	How should you start a physical examination?
	+	With a general inspection of the child.
	-	Always listen to the heart first before the child starts to cry.

	+	It is important to have warm hands.
	-	A nurse should hold the child still.
	-	Always place the child on an examination table.
14.	Should children be undressed for a physical examination?
	-	Only if the child appears to be ill.
	-	All children must be fully undressed.
	+	It may be best to undress only part of the child at a time.
