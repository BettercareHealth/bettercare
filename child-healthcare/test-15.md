# Test 15: Childhood mortality

1.	The under-5 mortality rate is expressed as the number of infants who die under the age of 5 years per:
	-	100 live births.
	+	1000 live births.
	-	100 000 live births.
	-	1 million live births.
2.	The infant mortality rate includes all infants who die under the age of:
	-	1 week.
	-	1 month.
	+	1 year.
	-	3 years.
3.	How is mortality rate best expressed?
	-	Deaths per month.
	-	Deaths per 6 months.
	+	Deaths per year.
	-	Deaths per 10 years.
4.	It is best to calculate the mortality rate:
	-	For each hospital separately.
	-	For all the clinics in a health district combined.
	-	For the hospital and all the clinics in a health region combined.
	+	For the whole region which is serviced by that hospital and those clinics.
5.	Why is it important to know the under-5 mortality rate?
	+	It is one of the best methods of assessing the wellbeing of children.
	-	It is important for medicolegal reasons.
	-	It is important for political reasons.
	-	It is important to motivate for more paediatrically trained nurses.
6.	What determines the under-5 mortality rate?
	-	The gross national income.
	-	The number of private doctors in the country.
	+	The health, nutrition and home environment of children.
	-	The number of tertiary hospitals.
7.	What is the under-5 mortality rate in most well resourced countries?
	-	Less than 5
	+	Less than 10
	-	Less than 50
	-	Less than 100.	
8.	What is the estimated under-5 mortality rate in South Africa?
	-	15
	-	30
	+	70
	-	90
9.	Which childhood deaths should be notified?
	+	All childhood deaths.
	-	Only deaths in hospital.
	-	Deaths in all hospitals and clinics.
	-	Only deaths where the cause is known.
10.	When is the best time to record the clinical details after a child has died?
	+	As soon as possible after the death.
	-	When the patientâ€™s hospital notes are summarised.
	-	Only after the post mortem examination.
	-	Only after the death has been fully discussed.
11.	What is the best way of determining the cause of childhood deaths?
	-	A doctor should examine all dead children.
	-	A post mortem examination should be done on all dead children.
	+	All childhood deaths should be discussed at a mortality meeting.
	-	All very ill children should be admitted to hospital to die.
12.	What is the aim of mortality meetings?
	-	To discipline the staff.
	+	To decide the cause of death and identify modifiable factors.
	-	To lecture the staff on the common causes of death.
	-	To collect accurate data for the annual hospital report.
13.	What is an important benefit of a mortality meeting?
	-	It saves having to summarise all the notes while writing a death report.
	-	It avoids doctors or nurses being sued for malpractice.
	+	It is an excellent opportunity to learn.
	-	It saves having to have staff meetings.
14.	Who at a mortality meeting should decide why the child died?
	-	The most senior doctor.
	-	The hospital administrator.
	-	The doctor and nurse who last cared for the child.
	+	Everyone who attends the meeting.
15.	What is a modifiable factor?
	-	An example of good care.
	+	A missed opportunity or substandard care.
	-	Part of care that only doctors can provide.
	-	Something which cannot be corrected.
16.	Modifiable factors:
	-	Are always related to the family or caregiver.
	-	Are never related to the clinical personnel.
	-	Are the responsibility of the administration.
	+	May be due to factors relating to the family, staff or administration.
17.	What is the commonest cause of under-5 deaths in South Africa (and most developing countries)?
	+	Infection.
	-	Malnutrition.
	-	Violence.
	-	Cancer.
18.	How will AIDS affect the under-5 mortality in developing countries?
	-	Very little as there are so many other causes.
	-	It should make little difference as children are unlikely to become infected with HIV.
	-	It may increase the number of deaths in the towns and cities only.
	+	It will cause a marked increase in the mortality rate.
19.	When should the HIV status be assessed in childhood deaths?
	-	It is not routinely recorded as most ill children do not have an HIV screening test.
	-	It is not needed if the cause of death is already known.
	+	It should always be assessed clinically if screening tests have not been done.
	-	Blood tests for HIV should be done on all dead children.
20.	The nutritional status should be assessed and recorded:
	+	In all childhood deaths.
	-	Only if the child came from a poor home or was neglected.
	-	Only if the child died of infection such as TB or diarrhoea.
	-	Only if the child had not routinely attended clinic.
