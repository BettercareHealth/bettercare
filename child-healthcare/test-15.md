	-	For the hospital and all the clinics in a health region combined.
	+	For the whole region which is serviced by that hospital and those clinics.

	+	It is one of the best methods of assessing the wellbeing of children.
	-	It is important for medicolegal reasons.
	-	It is important for political reasons.
	-	It is important to motivate for more paediatrically trained nurses.
6.	What determines the under-5 mortality rate?
	-	The gross national income.
	-	The number of private doctors in the country.
	+	The health, nutrition and home environment of children.
	-	The number of tertiary hospitals.

	-	It may increase the number of deaths in the towns and cities only.
	+	It will cause a marked increase in the mortality rate.
19.	When should the HIV status be assessed in childhood deaths?
	-	It is not routinely recorded as most ill children do not have an HIV screening test.
	-	It is not needed if the cause of death is already known.
