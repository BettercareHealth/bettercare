## Birth defects

### 1-1 What is a birth defect?

A birth defect is an abnormality of structure or function in a person, which is present from birth. The birth defect may be clinically obvious at birth, or may only be diagnosed sometime later in life. For example, a neural tube defect is a structural defect which is obvious at birth while haemophilia, which is also present at birth, is a functional defect that may only become obvious and be diagnosed when the child is older. Birth defects often present as an abnormal appearance or failure to grow and develop normally.

> A birth defect is a structural or functional abnormality which is present from birth.

Congenital disorder is another term that has the same meaning and definition as birth defect. Congenital means ‘present at birth’.

Malformations are the commonest form of birth defect. Congenital malformations develop during the first trimester and are caused by failure of the embryo to develop normally. This results in a birth defect of one or more organs (e.g. heart, eye, brain).

> Congenital malformations occur early in pregnancy when the embryo is still forming.

Note
:	An individual with an abnormal appearance is said to be ‘dysmorphic’. It is important to differentiate dysmorphic features from the normal range of features found in a family or community.

### 1-2 Are all birth defects serious?

No. Birth defects may be mild or serious. A mild defect causes no disability. However, a person with a serious birth defect may die soon after birth, or survive with a disability due to the direct effect of the birth defect (e.g. neural tube defect) or due to a secondary effect (e.g. joint damage resulting from bleeding in haemophilia). Some serious birth defects can be treated and this may be life-saving or prevent or reduce serious disability.

Birth defects can cause a wide range of disability, e.g. physical disability, intellectual disability, blindness, deafness and epilepsy.

> Serious birth defects can cause death or disability.

### 1-3 How is the frequency of birth defects measured?

The frequency of birth defects (i.e. how common are individuals with a birth defect) is expressed as population prevalence and birth prevalence:

1.	The **population prevalence** is defined as the number of affected individuals per 1000 or 10 000 or 100 000 people, depending on how common or rare the disorder is, in a given population at a certain time, e.g. the population prevalence of Down syndrome in rural Limpopo was 7.5/10 000 children between 1994 and 1997. Therefore the population prevalence is a measure of how common a birth defect is in the general population.
2.	The **birth prevalence** is defined as the number of affected infants per 1000 live births, e.g. the birth prevalence of Down syndrome in rural Limpopo is 2.1/1000 live births. It is therefore a measure of how common a defect is among newborn infants.

### 1-4 How common are birth defects?

At birth two to three percent of live newborn infants can be recognised as having a birth defect, i.e. the recognisable birth prevalence for all defects is 20–30/1000 live births in the first month of life.

However, not all birth defects are diagnosed at or around birth, and by five years of age between four and eight percent of children in different countries are considered to have suffered the effects of a serious birth defect, i.e. a birth prevalence of 40–80/1000 live births.

The birth prevalence of serious birth defects varies from 40/1000 live births in industrialised countries to as high as 80/1000 in some developing countries.

> The birth prevalence of serious birth defects is lower in industrial countries than in developing countries.

Note
:	Research done in rural Limpopo province, South Africa, by genetic trained nursing staff examining newborn infants on day one of life recorded a birth prevalence of serious defects of 15/1000 live births (1.5% of live births). Birth defects can be diagnosed at any age from the newborn period (birth to 28 days) through to adulthood. Examples of birth defects that can present for the first time in adulthood include inherited cancers, Huntington disease and adult onset polycystic kidney disease.

### 1-5 If birth defects are so common why are they not seen more frequently at clinics?

1.	Infants and children with serious birth defects are very likely to die when they are young, especially if there are inadequate medical services available for their care. Therefore many infants do not live long enough to be seen at clinics.
2.	Many birth defects are not recognised and diagnosed.
3.	It is often not realised that many of the conditions seen in clinics and hospital have a congenital origin, e.g. many forms of intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, deafness and blindness. Up to 50% of these disorders may be due to birth defects.

Therefore both the birth prevalence and population prevalence of birth defects in developing countries may seem to be much lower than it really is.

Note
:	Another reason why infants and children with birth defects are not seen is that their parents do not take them to hospital or clinic because they feel that they will not receive adequate attention or care, and the visit will be an unjustified burden on their limited family resources. Experience from Limpopo showed that when genetic clinics were established, the population soon got to know and parents brought their children with birth defects.

### 1-6 How many children die from birth defects?

In South Africa about 1 million infants are born annually. Based on the available evidence, about 72 000 infants are born each year with a severe birth defect. Of these infants, about 25% will die in the first five years of life.

It is estimated that 9 million children are born in the world each year with a serious birth defect. Of these children, at least 8.4 million (93%) are born in developing countries. A minimum of 3.3 million children with a serious birth defect are estimated to die annually.

Note
:	It is quoted as a general rule that in industrialised countries 30% of children with serious birth defects will die in infancy (the first year of life), 30% will live with disability even if treatment is available, and 40% can largely be cured (mainly by surgery). Similar figures for developing countries are not available, but the number that die or are successfully treated will depend on the level of available health care. Currently at least 3.3 million children with a serious birth defect die annually.

> Birth defects are an important cause of infant and childhood death.

## Causes of birth defects

### 1-7 What are the causes of birth defects?

Birth defects are caused by:

1.	Problems that are present before conception (about 40% of birth defects):
	*	Chromosome abnormalities.
	*	Single gene defects.
	*	Multifactorial disorders.

	These are also known as genetic causes of birth defects.

2.	Problems occurring after conception (about 10% of birth defects):
	*	Teratogens.
	*	Constraint.

	These are non-genetic causes of birth defects. Note that all birth defects are not due to genetic causes.

3.	Cause not yet known (about 50% of birth defects).

Note
:	The percentages given above are for industrialised countries. Figures for developing countries are not available.

> The cause of about 50% of birth defects is not yet known.

## Chromosomal inheritance

### 1-8 What are chromosomes?

Chromosomes are packages of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the genetic material found in all cells. A person’s genetic plan of all their inherited characteristics is stored in their chromosomes.

Human cells have 46 chromosomes that are contained in the nucleus of the cell. The chromosomes are paired (23 pairs), with 22 pairs called autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Each pair of autosomes looks the same. The pair of sex chromosomes do not look the same because the X chromosome is longer than the Y chromosome.

Females have two X chromosomes (i.e. XX) while males have one X and one Y chromosome (i.e. XY). Like the 22 autosomes, the pair of X chromosomes in females look alike.

A picture of the 46 chromosomes is called a karyotype. The normal female karyotype can be written as 46,XX and the normal male karyotype as 46,XY. Each pair of autosomes is given a number (1 to 22).

> Humans have 46 chromosomes in each cell, 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes.

Note
:	In some textbooks, 46,XY is still written as 46 XY. 46,XY is preferable.

### 1-9 How are chromosomes inherited?

One chromosome of each pair of chromosomes is inherited from the mother and the other chromosome from the father. Therefore, both the mother and father give one chromosome to each pair of chromosomes found in the child. Half of the inheritance plan of each individual is inherited from the mother and the other half from the father. This is called sexual reproduction. An infant’s genetic plan is, therefore, inherited from both parents. This is why the inherited characteristics of the parents are shared in the child, and the child has features of both parents.

When the ova (female eggs) are produced in the mother’s ovaries, and the sperms (male eggs) in the father’s testicles, the 46 chromosomes in the parent’s stem cells divide with only one copy of each chromosome pair still remaining in each ovum or sperm. The ova and sperms (also called gametes or sex cells), therefore, only have 23 chromosomes each.

With fertilisation, a sperm and an ovum unite and combine their chromosomes to form the zygote (the first cell which will eventually develop into the fetus). The zygote therefore has 46 chromosomes, half (23) from the mother and half (23) from the father. The zygote divides, multiplies and grows to become an embryo (with cells developing into different organs). The embryo develops into the fetus (with formed organs). After delivery the fetus is called the newborn infant.

> Each parent gives 23 chromosomes which combine at fertilisation to give a total of 46 chromosomes in the zygote.

Note
:	All living organisms, plants and animals, have chromosomes. In humans the 46 chromosomes are known as the diploid number of chromosomes and the 23 chromosomes in the gametes as the haploid number. The process of cell division in which the gametes are formed and the number of chromosomes is halved (from 46 to 23) is called meiosis. After meiosis the ovum contains 22 autosomes and an X chromosome, and each sperm has 22 autosomes plus either an X or a Y chromosome.

	Cell division in which the chromosome number stays the same can also occur (asexual reproduction) and this is called mitosis. This is the type of cell reproduction that occurs to make more cells so that the zygote can multiply and develop into an embryo and fetus, and the body can grow or replace cells that die off during life.

### 1-10 What are chromosome abnormalities?

The process of reproduction (when the ova and sperms are made, fertilised and divide after conception) is not always perfect. Abnormalities can occur in the chromosomes and they may result in a child with a birth defect. These chromosome abnormalities are mostly sporadic, i.e. due to chance.

Chromosome abnormalities include:

1.	An abnormal number of chromosomes in the cells:
	*	Trisomy.
	*	Monosomy.
	*	Mosaicism.
2.	An abnormal structure of chromosomes in the cells:
	*	Translocation.
	*	Deletion.

If a whole chromosome or part of a chromosome is gained or lost in the process of reproduction, then the zygote that results will be abnormal as its genetic plan will have more or less genetic information than it should have. The abnormal embryo may abort spontaneously or result in an infant with a birth defect. Chromosomal disorders usually present with multiple abnormalities, including an abnormal appearance (dysmorphic features), developmental and growth delay and malformations. As most chromosomal abnormalities are not inherited, the risk of more than one child being affected (recurrence) is low.

> The risk of the same chromosome disorder occurring more than once in a family is low.

### 1-11 What are trisomy and monosomy?

This occurs during the formation of the gametes (ova or sperms) when a pair of the parent’s chromosome does not split normally. Instead of one chromosome of a pair going to each gamete, one gamete gets both the paired chromosomes, and therefore has 24 chromosomes, while the other gamete does not get a copy of that chromosome and, therefore, only has 22 chromosomes. This abnormal process of cell division, which results in two abnormal gametes, is known as non-disjunction.

When either of these two abnormal gametes fertilise with a normal gamete (containing 23 chromosomes) the resulting zygote will have either of the following:

1.	An extra chromosome (trisomy) with 47 (i.e. 24 +23) chromosomes in the cell.
2.	One chromosome less (monosomy) with 45 (i.e. 22+23) chromosomes in the cell.

From an abnormal zygote with 47 chromosomes (trisomy) the fetus that develops will have cells with 47 chromosomes. Similarly, for a zygote with 45 chromosomes (monosomy), the fetus will have cells with 45 chromosomes.

> Trisomy and monosomy are caused by non-disjunction.

### 1-12 What birth defects are caused by trisomy and monosomy?

Many of the common chromosomal disorders (chromosomal birth defects) are caused by non-disjunction and the resulting trisomy or monosomy of different chromosomes. Most fetuses with trisomy and monosomy are not capable of living and result in early spontaneous abortion.

The chromosomes which can result in an infant being born alive and surviving with trisomy are 13, 18, 21, X and Y. The common trisomies are:

1.	Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome (i.e. 47,XY+ 21 or 47,XX+21).
1.	Trisomy 18 or Edward syndrome (i.e. 47,XY +18 or 47,XX+18).
1.	Trisomy 13 or Patau syndrome (i.e. 47,XY+ 13 or 46,XX+13).
1.	XXY in a male or Klinefelter syndrome (i.e. 47,XXY).
1.	Trisomy X in a female (i.e. 47,XXX).
1.	XYY in a male (i.e. 47,XYY).

Down syndrome, with trisomy of chromosome 21, is the commonest form of chromosomal birth defect.

The only chromosome that can be lost and result in a live born infant with monosomy is a sex chromosome X or Y. Therefore, the only monosomy seen is Turner syndrome (i.e. 45,X).

> Down syndrome, with trisomy of chromosome 21, is the commonest form of chromosomal birth defect.

### 1-13 What is mosaicism?

In the normal zygote there are 46 chromo­somes. The zygote then begins dividing by mitosis to form the embryo which contains many cells. This division of the one-celled zygote results in a doubling of cells to 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 cells and so on, with all the cells having 46 chromosomes. However, in mosaicism, an error occurs in the zygote. Early on in this dividing process one of the cells is involved in non-disjunction resulting in one cell having 47 chromosomes (trisomy) and the other cell only 45 chromosomes (monosomy). The monosomy cell usually dies but the trisomy cell may survive and divide. All future cells that come from it will be trisomy cells. Therefore, the embryo, fetus and infant that result will have some cells which are normal with 46 chromosomes and other cells which are abnormal with 47 chromosomes. This is called mosaicism (the presence of 2 different cell lines of the same genetic origin in a person).

As an example, if the non-disjunction was with chromosome 21 in a female then the newborn infant would have some cells of 46,XX and others of 47,XX +21 resulting in mosaic Down syndrome (46,XX/47,XX +21). Mosaicism causes 1 to 2% of the infants born with Down syndrome. People with Turner syndrome can also be mosaic (46,XX/45,X0).

Note
:	Rarely, people are found with an extra piece of chromosome material that is called a marker chromosome. How this affects the person depends on what piece of chromosome is involved. Some people with marker chromosomes are normal, while others can have a chromosome disorder.

	In the formation of gametes (ova or sperms, if none of the chromosome pairs separate, then 46 chromosomes will go to one gamete and none to the other gamete. If the gamete with 46 chromosomes becomes fertilised with a normal gamete with 23 chromosomes, the resulting zygote will have an extra set of chromosomes, i.e. 69 chromosomes (69,XXX or 69,XXY). This is called triploidy. It is also possible to have more than one extra set of chromosomes (polyploidy). Embryos with polyploidy usually abort spontaneously early in pregnancy. On the rare occasion when a triploidy (three sets of chromosomes) infant is born, it is very abnormal and either dies before delivery or very early in the neonatal period.

### 1-14 What is a chromosome translocation?

Translocation occurs when a piece of one chromosome breaks off and joins (translocates) onto another chromosome. If in this process no genetic material is lost or gained, this is called a ‘balanced’ translocation and the person is clinically normal. However, if chromosome material is lost or gained then this is an ‘unbalanced translocation’ and the person will be abnormal because their genetic plan has lost or gained genetic material.

Persons with balanced translocations are at risk of passing on the abnormal chromosomes to their offspring, resulting in abnormal embryos with unbalanced translocations. This can be the cause of recurrent spontaneous abortions. If the embryo survives, the resulting infant will be abnormal. This risk varies according to the type of translocation.

### 1-15 What is a chromosome deletion?

This occurs when a piece of a chromosome, big or small, is missing. There are several recognised syndromes in which a known piece of chromosome is missing. These include:

1.	Prader Willi syndrome with deletion of a specific piece of chromosome 15.
2.	Deletion 22 syndrome with deletion of a specific piece of chromosome 22.
3.	Cri du chat (cry of a cat) syndrome with loss of a piece of the small arm of chromosome 5.

Note
:	Sometimes a piece of chromosome copies itself and therefore the chromosome has two identical pieces of the chromosome and the genetic plan has extra chromosome material. This is called chromosomal duplication. There are recognised chromosome duplication syndromes, e.g. Cat Eye syndrome in which a piece of chromosome 22 is duplicated.

	A piece of one end of a chromosome may come off (deleted) making it sticky. This end then sticks to the other end making a ‘ring’ chromosome. Because genetic material is lost from the one end of the chromosome in the process, the person usually has a chromosome disorder, often associated with growth failure and intellectual disability.

## Inheritance of single gene defects

### 1-16 What is a gene?

The genetic material on chromosomes is divided up into smaller packages of DNA called genes. Like chromosomes, genes occur in pairs, one gene from each parent. Together, each pair of genes usually determines a single inherited function by giving a set of instructions to the cell, such as a physical feature (e.g. hair colour) or a single biochemical product (e.g. production of a protein or an enzyme).

Genes make up the smallest parts of the genetic code. Children look like their parents because their genes are a mixture that is inherited from both mother and father. As this combination varies with each child, siblings look alike and yet have their differences. The only individuals with identical genes are identical twins.

> A gene is a small section of a chromosome and controls a cell function. Genes occur in pairs, one being inherited from each parent.

### 1-17 What is a single gene defect?

On the chromosomes, a person’s genetic plan is coded (‘written’) in thousands of genes. Genes on the 22 autosomes and two X chromosomes always occur in pairs (alleles). One gene in each matching pair is inherited from the mother and the other gene in that pair is inherited from the father. Each pair of genes together codes for an inherited biochemical product (e.g. blood clotting factor) or physical feature (e.g. eye colour) and gives the cell an instruction to carry out a particular activity. If the structure of the gene is abnormal, the instruction will also be abnormal and this may be harmful to the individual. A birth defect that results from an abnormality in a gene is called a single gene defect.

> A birth defect caused by an abnormality in a gene is called a single gene defect.

Note
:	It is estimated that humans have about 20 000 pairs of genes. Over 6000 single gene defects have been described.

### 1-18 How do genes become abnormal?

Almost all genes are normal and give the cell correct instructions. However, a gene can become abnormal by mutation. With a mutation, the DNA structure of a gene changes.

> A mutation is a change in gene structure that can cause abnormal gene fuction and a birth defect.

Mutations are rare and may occur sponta­neously or be caused by environmental factors, including radiation (solar radiation from the sun, nuclear radiation or excessive X-rays). These abnormal genes can be passed onto the next generation in the same way as normal genes are inherited. As a result, single gene defects are usually inherited (unlike chromosomal defects).

> Single gene defects are usually inherited.

Note
:	In a mutation, the gene gives instructions for an incorrect sequence of amino acids and, therefore, an abnormal protein or enzyme is formed. A mutated gene may cause a clinical problem (e.g. haemophilia), a mild variant (e.g. red hair) or rarely a survival advantage (e.g. resistance against malaria).

### 1-19 What type of genes occur?

A gene may be either a dominant or a recessive gene. Both dominant and recessive genes may be normal or abnormal.

> Genes can be either dominant or recessive.

## Dominant inheritance

### 1-20 What is a dominant gene?

In a pair of genes (alleles), the individual genes may be of different strengths, with the one being ‘stronger’ and the other being ‘weaker’. The ‘stronger’ gene dominates (overpowers) the ‘weaker’ gene. Therefore, the ‘stronger’ gene is called a dominant gene. The dominant gene controls the function of that gene pair (alleles).

> A dominant gene controls the function of that gene pair.

If the dominant gene is abnormal, then the instructions sent from that gene pair will also be abnormal. As a result the cell may not function normally, causing a birth defect.

If the dominant gene is on one of the 22 autosomes, it is called an autosomal dominant gene. A clinical disorder caused by a mutation in an autosomal dominant gene is called an autosomal dominant disorder. These conditions may be mild or severe but usually are not lethal (otherwise they probably would not be passed on to the next generation). Males and females are equally affected by autosomal dominant disorders.

### 1-21 How are autosomal dominant genes inherited?

If either the father or mother has an autosomal dominant gene, there is a 50% chance of passing that gene on to each of their children. Both sons and daughter have an equal chance of inheriting an autosomal dominant gene.

> There is a 50% chance of inheriting a dominant gene from a parent.

If the autosomal dominant gene causes an abnormality of structure or function, the genetic abnormality will be present in the parent with that gene, and also in each child that inherits that abnormal gene. Autosomal dominant disorders are, therefore, passed from one generation to the next. The clinical effect of the abnormal gene will usually be present in both parent and child.

While most autosomal dominant genes are inherited, an autosomal dominant gene may also appear in a person for the first time in a family as a result of a new mutation. That gene will not be present in either parent. Therefore, the parents will be normal but the child will have the disorder. However, the new mutated gene can be passed onto future generations in the same way as other autosomal dominant genes are inherited.

Note
:	In a single family, some members will show all the clinical features caused by the dominant gene while others who inherit the gene may only show (express) some features. This is known as variable expression (e.g. neurofibromatosis). Some family members with a dominant gene may not show any features of that gene at all. This is called variable penetrance (e.g. polydactyly).

Note
:	If both parents have the same dominant gene, there is a 75% chance (3 out of 4) that each child will inherit that gene. There is also a 25% chance (1 in 4) of the child inheriting both dominant genes, which is usually fatal if the dominant genes are abnormal. Therefore, all children will inherit either one or both dominant genes.

## Recessive inheritance

### 1-22 What is a recessive gene?

If a dominant gene overpowers (suppresses) a ‘weaker’ gene, the weaker gene is called a recessive gene. The dominant gene will control the function of that pair of genes. As a result, the instructions sent to the cell will be that of the dominant gene only. Therefore, the recessive gene will have no control over the cell and its effect will be ‘hidden’ or suppressed.

A person is called a carrier if she/he carries a ‘hidden’ recessive gene. In a carrier the effect of an abnormal recessive gene is not seen and the individual appears normal.

A person who has both a dominant and a recessive gene (a carrier), is said to be heterozygous for that pair of genes. If both genes are the same (both genes are dominant or both recessive), the person is said to be homozygous for that pair of genes. Only if both genes are recessive will the recessive genes together control that function of the cells. They are able to do this as there is no dominant gene. Recessive genes may be normal (e.g. carry instructions for blue eyes) or abnormal (e.g. carry instructions for oculocutaneous albinism). If both recessive genes are abnormal, that function of the cell will also be abnormal. A clinically normal carrier has both a normal (dominant) and an abnormal (recessive) gene for that feature.

A recessive gene on an autosome is called an autosomal recessive gene.

Note
:	We all carry five to 10 abnormal recessive genes. As we are heterozygous for that gene (single copy), it generally has no effect on our health. Only if we are homozygous (double dose) for the same gene will we be clinically affected.

### 1-23 How are autosomal recessive genes inherited?

If both parents are carriers (i.e. they are heterozygous) for the same recessive gene, their children will have a 25% chance of inheriting the recessive gene from both mother and father (i.e. the child will be homozygous). Their children will also have a 50% chance of inheriting a recessive gene from only one parent to become a carrier (i.e. heterozygous). Getting the same recessive gene from both parents is commoner if the parents are closely related, e.g. siblings, cousins or an uncle and a niece (intermarriage or a consanguineous relationship), as they may inherit the same recessive gene from a common ancestor (e.g. grandparent).

With autosomal recessive inheritance, the parents and grandparents are usually normal and do not show the effect of the recessive gene. If a child inherits two abnormal autosomal recessive genes (i.e. one from each parent), they will have an autosomal recessive disorder. The risk of an autosomal recessive disorder is much higher if the parents are closely related (consanguineous).

The majority of single gene defects are autosomal recessive. Males and females are equally at risk of an autosomal recessive disorder.

If only one parent is heterozygous (a carrier), the children cannot be affected but they have a 50% risk of inheriting the recessive gene and, therefore, also being a carrier.

> If both parents are carriers of a recessive gene, there is a 25% chance (1 in 4) that their child will inherit both recessive genes.

### 1-24 What is X-linked recessive inheritance?

If a recessive gene is on an X chromosome, it is called an X-linked recessive gene (X-linked dominant genes and Y-linked genes are very rare).

X-linked recessive genes are inherited by girls in the same way as autosomal recessive genes. Girls have two X chromosomes and all the X-linked genes are in pairs. However, as the X and Y chromosomes are not identical (the Y chromosome is very short) the X-linked recessive genes in a male are not matched to a gene on the Y chromosome. Therefore, the X-linked gene, whether dominant or recessive, alone controls that cell function in males. As with autosomal recessive inheritance, a mother have a 50% chance (1 in 2) of passing her X-linked recessive gene to both her sons and daughters. However, it will only influence the function of the cell in her sons. It has no effect in her daughters as the gene is matched by a gene on the other X chromosome, inherited from the father.

Therefore, disorders caused by X-linked recessive genes are carried by females and affect males. Males have unaffected sons as they give them their Y and not their X chromosomes. However, there is a 100% chance that each daughter of an affected male will be a carrier.

Disorders caused by an X-linked recessive gene are called X-linked recessive disorders, e.g. colour blindness and haemophilia.

> X-linked recessive disorders affect males and not females.

Note
:	In males, an X-linked recessive gene acts as if it were a dominant gene as it is unopposed by the function of a matching gene. Females may have X-linked recessive disorders (e.g. colour blindness) if they inherit the abnormal recessive gene from both parents, i.e. both their X chromosomes carry the abnormal gene. Their father will be affected by the disorder while their mother will be a carrier. Rarely, females who carry an X-linked gene may show mild signs of the disorder, e.g. haemophilia.

> X-linked recessive genes are carried by mothers and affect 50% of their sons.

## Single gene disorders

### 1-25 What are the common single gene disorders?

The most common autosomal dominant disorders are:

1.	Polydactyly (extra digits).
1.	Achondroplasia (short-limbed dwarfism).
1.	Neurofibromatosis.

The most common autosomal recessive disorders are:

1.	Sickle cell anaemia.
1.	Thalassaemia.
1.	Oculocutaneous albinism.

Cystic fibrosis (the one autosomal recessive disorder that is common in people of European descent).

The most common X-linked recessive conditions are:

1.	Red–green colour blindness.
1.	Haemophilia.
1.	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD).

Some single gene disorders are more common in particular populations or regions, e.g. sickle cell anaemia in West Africa, cystic fibrosis in Europe, thalassaemia in Mediterranean countries, polydactyly in black South Africans. Most autosomal recessive conditions are found in, or come from, tropical countries. Cystic fibrosis is the one autosomal recessive disorder that is common in people of European descent.

Some conditions, such as polycystic kidneys, osteogenesis imperfecta, retinitis pigmentosa and mental retardation, may be inherited by more than one mode of inheritance, e.g. in some families as a dominant while in other families as a recessive disorder.

## Multifactorial birth defects

### 1-26 What are multifactorial birth defects?

These are birth defects that have a combined genetic and environmental cause. The environmental factor (or factors) is often not known. The person affected with a multifactorial birth defect inherits a combination of genes from their parents that places them at an increased risk for a birth defect. If that individual then experiences certain environmental factors, the result will be a multifactorial birth defect. Multifactorial birth defects, therefore, require both genetic and environmental factors before they present. Neither the genetic factor nor the environmental factor alone will cause the birth defect. The risk that another child of the same parents will be affected by a multifactorial birth defect is small (about 5%). The risk of recurrence increases if more than one family member is affected.

Multifactorial birth defects are the commonest form of birth defect and usually affect a single limb, organ or system. They often present in infancy or childhood as congenital malformations such as:

1.	Neural tube defects.
1.	Isolated hydrocephalus.
1.	Clubfoot.
1.	Cleft lip and/or palate.
1.	Congenital heart defects.

> Multifactoral birth defects are common but usually involve a single limb, organ or system and have a low risk of recurrence.

## Teratogens

### 1-27 What is a teratogen?

A teratogen is a fetal environmental factor that can cause a birth defect. This is different from multifactorial birth defects as teratogens cause birth defects without an obvious genetic factor. Therefore the chromosomes and genes are normal in children with birth defects caused by a teratogen.

A teratogen can be a chemical substance like alcohol, an infection like the rubella virus (German measles) or a physical agent like X-rays. Teratogens interfere with normal development of the embryo usually early in pregnancy, but some can also damage the fetus later in pregnancy. If exposure to the teratogen is removed, there is little risk of a similar birth defect in a further child in that family.

### 1-28 When does a teratogen do the most damage?

The development of an infant from conception to birth is divided into three phases. The effect of teratogens is different in each of these phases:

1.	**The pre-implantation phase**: (1–17 days post conception or two to four weeks after the start of the last menstrual period).

	During this phase the fertilised egg (zygote) develops from one cell to a ball of many cells (the conceptus). The conceptus floats in a layer of fluid which carries it from the fallopian tube into the uterus. At about 17 days post conception (four weeks after the start of the last menstrual period) the conceptus begins to burrow into the lining of the uterus. Implantation and the development of the placenta and umbilical cord now begin.

	Before implantation it is very difficult for a teratogen to get to the developing conceptus and damage it. In the unlikely event that a teratogen does damage the conceptus, it is so small and fragile that it would die. Implantation would not happen and the women would not even know she had conceived. Therefore, teratogens do NOT cause birth defects in the pre-implantation phase (1–17 days post conception or two to four weeks after the last menstrual period).

	> Teratogens do not cause birth defects during the pre-implantation phase of development.

2.	**The embryonic phase**: (17–6 days post conception or 4–10 weeks after the start of the last menstrual period).

	With implantation and the development of the placenta, the developing infants is now called an embryo. The embryo and mother are in very close contact and a teratogen can now move easily from the mother through the placenta to the embryo. During this phase the organs of the body are developing. They are very sensitive and are easily damaged by teratogens. Teratogens do the most damage in the embryonic phase. Structural birth defects that occur during the embryonic phase are called malformations, e.g. a cleft lip.

	> Teratogens cause the most damage in the embryonic phase of development from four to 10 weeks after the start of the last menstrual period.

3.	**The fetal phase**: (six days after conception to birth or from 10 weeks after the start of the last menstrual period to delivery).

	By six days after conception the embryo has turned into a fetus with fully formed organs. The fetus still needs to grow and mature before being born. Teratogens generally do little damage to the fetus in this phase of development, but there are some exceptions. For example, the fetal brain, which can be damaged more easily than other organs, can still be affected in this phase by some teratogens, particularly drugs like alcohol.

### 1-29 What are examples of teratogens?

1.	Maternal infections:
	*	Rubella virus.
	*	Cytomegalovirus (CMV).
	*	Toxoplasmosis.
	*	Herpes simplex virus.
	*	Varicella virus (chicken pox and herpes zoster).

	Note
	:	Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus and Herpes are known as the TORCH organisms.

2.	Maternal illnesses:
	*	Diabetes mellitus.
	*	Epilepsy.
3.	Radiation in very large doses:
	*	Excessive amounts of X-ray.
	*	Nuclear radiation (e.g. Chernobyl).
4.	Drugs:
	*	Alcohol.
	*	Retinoic acid (for severe acne).
	*	Some antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline, streptomycin).
	*	Anti-cancer drugs (e.g. methotrexate, thalidomide).
	*	Warfarin (an anticoagulant).
	*	Some anti-convulsants (e.g. phenytoin, valproic acid).
	*	Lithium (an antidepressant).
5.	Environmental pollutants:
	*	Methyl mercury.
	*	There are probably many more which have not yet been identified.

## Constraint

### 1-30 What is constraint?

External forces can result in birth defects after the fetus is normally formed (i.e. it is not a malformation). The cause of this type of birth defects is called constraint. There are two types of birth defects due to constraint:

1.	Occasionally a normally formed fetus is pushed out of shape by mechanical force in the uterus (e.g. in multiple pregnancies, where there is little space in the uterus, or with oligohydramnios or large uterine fibroids). The head or chest may have an abnormal shape or the limbs may be bent. This type of birth defect is called a deformity. Deformities usually correct themselves after delivery once the pressure has been removed.
2.	Sometimes an amniotic band may damage a limb or other part of the body. A finger, toe or part of a limb may be amputated or have a constriction ring. The amniotic band results from a tear in the amnion early in pregnancy. This uncommon form of birth defect is called a disruption.

> Constraint is the type of birth defect caused by local mechanical pressure in the uterus deforming or disrupting part of the fetus.

Birth defects may, therefore be divided into:

1.	Malformations. Congenital malformations develop during the first trimester and are caused by failure of the embryo to develop normally.
2.	Deformations.
3.	Disruptions.

Placing a birth defect into one of these three categories helps to identify the probable cause and timing of the defect.

## Case study 1

A newborn infant at a district hospital is recognised as having a birth defect. The midwife comments that she very rarely sees birth defects. The doctor does not know the cause of the birth defect.

### 1. What is a birth defect?

It is an abnormality of function or structure in a person which is present from birth.

### 2. Why are birth defects rarely seen?

Because many birth defects are not recognised. A child may even die of a birth defect without the correct diagnosis being made. As a result, birth defects are commoner than they seem to be.

### 3. What is birth prevalence?

The birth prevalence of a birth defect is the number of infants born with that birth defect per 1000 liveborn infants. In contrast, the prevalence of a birth defect is the number of individuals with that defect per 1000 people in that population.

### 4. What are the main known causes of a birth defect?

Birth defects may be caused by:

*	Problems at conception, such as chromosomal disorders, single gene defects or multifactorial disorders (genetic causes).
*	Problems after conception, such as teratogens or constraint (fetal environmental causes).

### 5. How often is a cause for a birth defect not found?

About 50%.

### 6. Are all birth defects due to genetic causes?

No. Birth defects due to teratogens and constraint are not due to genetic causes. Therefore, they usually do not recur in the same family.

## Case study 2

An infant is brought to hospital with multiple abnormalities which were present at birth. The doctor thinks that the birth defects are due to a chromosomal abnormality. A blood sample is sent to a genetic laboratory. The report states that the infant has a trisomy.

### 1. What is a chromosome?

Chromosomes are packages of DNA (a collection of genes) which makes up the genetic plan for the structure and functions of the body.

### 2. Are multiple birth defects often due to chromosomal defects?

Yes. Chromosomal defects usually cause multiple abnormalities including dysmorphic features, growth and developmental delay and malformations.

### 3. What is a trisomy?

With a trisomy the cells have three instead of two copies of a particular chromosome. For example, in Down syndrome due to trisomy, there are three instead of the normal two chromosomes 21.

### 4. What is the cause of trisomy?

Non-disjunction. During the formation of the gametes (egg or sperm), one gamete receives two chromosomes in error while the other gamete does not receive a chromosome (from that pair of chromosomes).

### 5. Is trisomy the only way to get extra genetic material?

No. With translocation a piece of one chromo­some may be moved onto another chromosome. If the gamete gets the chromo­some with the extra piece but not the chromo­some that has lost a piece, that gamete will have extra genetic material.

## Case study 3

Parents with brown eyes have a son with blue eyes. The father asks the genetic nurse how brown-eyed parents can have a blue-eyed child.

### 1. What determines the colour of a person’s eyes?

A single pair of genes. The gene for brown eyes is a dominant gene while the gene for blue eyes in a recessive gene.

### 2. Is the colour of a person’s eyes inherited?

Yes. The colour of your eyes depends on the genes for eye colour carried by your parents.

### 3. How can two brown-eyed parents have a child with blue eyes?

Because both parents are heterozygous, i.e. they each have one gene for brown eyes (dominant) and another for blue eyes (recessive). If they both give their recessive gene (for blue eyes) to their child, that child will be homozygous for the blue-eyed gene and, therefore, have blue eyes.

### 4. What is the chance of their future children also having blue eyes?

25%. This is the chance of being homozygous (having both genes recessive) if your parents are heterozygous. If one or both parents have two dominant genes for brown eyes, all their children will have brown eyes.

### 5. Are recessive genes always abnormal?

No. Many recessive genes (such as eye colour) are normal. However, recessive genes may be abnormal and, therefore, cause a clinical disorder when the child is homozygous.

## Case study 4

A young couple wants to get married. However, the man has a serious birth defect which has been diagnosed as an autosomal dominant disorder. They ask their general practitioner what the chances are that their children will inherit the problem. They mention that they are cousins.

### 1. What is an autosomal dominant disorder?

It is a clinical problem caused by having an abnormal dominant gene on an autosome.

### 2. What is an autosome?

One of the 22 pairs of non-sex chromosomes. The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes.

### 3. What is a dominant disorder?

It is a clinical condition caused by an abnormal dominant gene. A dominant gene is a ‘strong’ gene that will overpower a recessive gene with which it is paired. The dominant gene will determine the effect that pair of genes has on the cell.

### 4. What is the risk that their children will inherit their father’s abnormal autosomal dominant gene?

50%. Therefore, the risk of having the same birth defect (disorder) is also 50%.

### 5. Does it matter that they are cousins?

This will not affect the risk of the children inheriting the autosomal dominant disorder. It would, however, increase the risk of both parents being carriers (heterozygous) for an abnormal recessive gene.

## Case study 5

Healthy parents of six children plan to have one last child. They have three normal daughters and one normal son. However, their other two sons both have a similar birth defect. The mother’s sister also has a son with the same birth defect. They want to know what the risk is of the planned child having the birth defect that is common in the family.

### 1. What type of gene defect affects a number of children born to normal parents?

The pattern of inheritance suggests a recessive gene (either autosomal or X-linked).

### 2. Why are some of the boys and none of the girls affected?

This may be due to chance. However, it strongly suggests an abnormal X-linked recessive gene defect. The fact that the mother’s sister also has an affected son indicates an abnormal gene carried by the females and affecting the males in the family.

### 3. Which parent is probably a carrier of the abnormal gene?

The mother.

### 4. What is the risk of a further son being affected?

50%.

### 5. What is the risk of a further daughter being affected?

Nil. However, she has a 50% chance of being a carrier.

## Management of birth defects in a community

### 2-1 How is the problem of birth defects managed?

Managing the problem of birth defects requires the establishment of basic medical genetic services. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has defined the aim of medical genetic services as helping people with a genetic disadvantage (i.e. those affected and those at risk of having a child with a birth defect) to live and reproduce as normally as possible.

Medical genetic services require management programmes for birth defects. These consist of a comprehensive plan to:

1.	Provide the best possible care for people with birth defects, and for their families.
2.	Prevent birth defects by community education, periconception care, genetic counselling, medical genetic screening, and prenatal diagnosis and care.

> Medical genetic services combine the best possible patient care with the prevention of birth defects.

## Caring for people with birth defects

### 2-2 What care is needed for people with birth defects?

Caring for people with a birth defect involves three steps:

1.	**Recognising birth defects**

	A birth defect must be identified as early as possible to ensure the best response from treatment and genetic counselling. In low resource nations, primary health-care providers should learn to recognise birth defects and diagnose their country’s common and important birth defects. In South Africa these would include:

	*	Down syndrome.
	*	Oculocutaneous albinism.
	*	Waardenburg syndrome.
	*	Haemophilia.
	*	Fetal alcohol syndrome.
	*	Neural tube defects.
	*	Club foot.

	A definite diagnosis cannot always be made. However, it remains important to know that the person has a birth defect and to recognise the disabilities that may be associated with the birth defect.

2.	**Provide appropriate treatment**

	Having recognised a birth defect, the primary health-care provider has the responsibility for offering and providing appropriate treatment. This may be available in the local clinic or hospital or may require the patient to be transferred to a regional centre. Whenever possible, treatment should be provided in the primary health-care facility which is closest to the patient and the family’s home.

3.	**Offer genetic counselling and psychosocial support**

	With treatment the affected person and family, especially parents, should be offered genetic counselling and psychosocial support. As far as possible, for common disorders, this should occur at a primary health-care clinic or hospital. Counselling will help them understand and deal with the issues resulting from the birth defect.

### 2-3 Can all people with birth defects be offered the best possible care?

Yes. The World Health Organisation, in its discussions on the development of medical genetic services, realised that levels of health care are different between countries, and even within different regions of a country. Therefore, what can be offered to patients in different circumstances varies, but in any situation ‘the best possible patient care’ available should be offered.

In no circumstance should care not be offered.

### 2-4 How can you recognise a birth defect and make a genetic diagnosis?

A birth defect is identified and, where possible, a genetic diagnosis is made in the same way as all medical diagnoses by:

1.	Taking a full history: This includes a presenting history, birth history, past history, social history and a family history. The family history must be recorded as a three generation family tree. A positive family history of a disorder increases the risk of an inherited birth defect.
1.	Doing a physical examination: A full examination must be done. Many of the abnormal clinical signs (dysmorphic features) of birth defects are external and visible. These signs can be used to suggest a possible diagnosis. If a patient has three or more recognisable dysmorphic features or an obvious congenital malformation (e.g. cleft lip or spina bifida), this indicates a birth defect.
1.	Performing investigations: Investigations relevant to each case can be ordered and the results obtained.
1.	Making a final diagnosis: If possible a doctor should confirm the diagnosis before treatment and genetic counselling are offered. If a final diagnosis cannot be reached, and this is holding back the on-going treatment and counselling of the patient, referral to an appropriate centre must be considered.

> People with three or more dysmorphic features should be assessed for a birth defect.

### 2-5 What is a three-generation family tree?

This is a drawing of family members over at least three generations (a pedigree). It helps to make a genetic diagnosis and identify the method of inheritance of inherited birth defects. The three-generation family tree is drawn after taking a careful family history. Normal individuals, people with birth defects, probable carriers (autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive) and pregnancy losses are all plotted on the family tree. One line is used for each generation.

The following symbols are used in a three-generation family tree:

*	Males are indicated with a square.
*	Females are indicated with a circle.
*	A clear square or circle is used for normal individuals.
*	A completely filled in square or circle is used for affected individuals.
*	A half filled in square or circle indicates carriers of an autosomal recessive disorder (heterozygotes).
*	A circle with a dot in the centre represents a female carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder
*	A diagonal line through a square or circle indicates that the person has died.

Parents are linked to each other with a horizontal line (marriage or partnership line), while parents and children are linked with a vertical line (descent line). Two parallel lines link parents who are related (consanguineous).

### 2-6 What is a genetic diagnosis?

A genetic disanosis (or genetic medical diagnosis) is the diagnosis of a disorder which is caused by an abnormal chromosome or gene (a chromosomal or genetic abnormality). Sometimes a genetic diagnosis can be made clinically by recognising a pattern of abnormal clinical signs (a syndrome).

### 2-7 Can a genetic diagnosis always be made?

No. In about 40% of people with birth defects a definitive genetic diagnosis cannot be made (e.g. the person has dysmorphic features that do not fit into a recognisable syndrome). They may present with a variety of problems including intellectual, physical, auditory (hearing) and visual (sight) disability and epilepsy. Early recognition of these disabilities is important for treatment and genetic counselling. Care must be given even if a final diagnosis cannot be made.

> People with birth defects frequently present with disabilities which can usually be treated and counselled for.

### 2-8 What treatment is available for people with birth defects?

Four means of treatment for people with a birth defect are available. Many treatments cannot cure the problem, but they can improve the quality of life. Unfortunately, many of the latest treatment methods are expensive and not available in low resource countries, including South Africa.

1.	Medical treatment: People with birth defects often have problems that can be treated with medication. Because of limited resources in developing countries, primary health-care providers often have to give and monitor these medications, if necessary, in co-operation with specialists in secondary or tertiary care centres. Examples of medical treatment that can be undertaken in primary health-care centres include antibiotics for recurrent infections, sunscreen for oculocutaneous albinism, cardiac failure treatment, blood transfusion for anaemia, factor VIII or IX for haemophilia and anti-convulsant medicines for epilepsy.
2.	Surgical treatment: Surgery, especially paediatric surgery, often saves lives or offers significant improvement for many serious birth defects. At the primary health-care level, people with conditions that can benefit from surgery need to be recognised early and transferred to the appropriate surgical unit.

	Examples include surgery for meningomyelocoele, omphalocoele and heart defects, orthopaedic manipulation and surgery for club foot, removal of congenital cataracts, and surgery for cleft lip and palate. The transfer of the patients with a birth defect, such as an omphalocoele, needs to be carefully managed to ensure that the patient arrives in the best clinical condition possible.

3.	Neurodevelopmental therapy (NDT) and rehabilitation: This should include the availability of occupational, speech and physiotherapy, and other therapies needed for rehabilitation, e.g. stoma therapy for individuals with repaired meningomyelocoele who are incontinent. They assist people with birth defects to overcome their disabilities and to integrate into society to the greatest extent possible. In some developing countries, such as South Africa, where therapists are not always available, community-based rehabilitation programmes can be developed to undertake this task and help people with disability live and function in their community.
4.	Genetic counselling and psychosocial support: Genetic counselling and psychosocial support are a major part of caring for people with birth defects and their families.

## Prevention of birth defects

### 2-9 How can birth defects be prevented?

There are two practical approaches for the prevention of birth defects:

1.	Basic reproductive health approaches to prevent birth defects.
1.	Medical genetic (population) screening, prenatal diagnosis and genetic counselling.

### 2-10 What are basic reproductive health approaches?

These are methods of preventing birth defects by ensuring normal infants are conceived and the embryo and fetus is not damaged by teratogens or constraint during pregnancy (the first eight weeks after conception). These methods need to be in place before conception and are dependent on community education, especially the education of women. These methods are also referred to as ‘primary prevention of birth defects’ and are the preferred method for the prevention of birth defects. All countries should develop their medical services to include these methods of prevention of birth defects, which are mainly carried out in primary health-care centres. They include:

1.	Family planning.
1.	Periconception care.

> Basic reproductive health approaches are methods aimed at the primary prevention of birth defects.

### 2-11 How can family planning prevent birth defects?

A functional, accessible family planning service that is well used by people is essential for the prevention of birth defects. If this service is available:

1.	Women have the option of limiting their family size. As a result, fewer infants are planned for and born. Therefore, fewer infants with birth defects are born.
1.	Women of advanced maternal age (35 years or older) can reduce their risk of having an infant with a chromosomal abnormality, particularly Down syndrome. This risk increases as they get older. Family planning allows these women the option of completing their families before 35 years of age.
1.	Women who have had a child with a birth defect that is inherited are at risk in following pregnancies of having further affected children. With family planning they have the option of not having more children.

### 2-12 What is periconception care?

Periconception care is the care of women’s health before conception (i.e. before falling pregnant) and in early pregnancy (the first eight weeks) to prevent birth defects. Periconception care tries to ensure the best possible health care for women to help them conceive a normal infant and to reduce the risks of damage to the embryo in early pregnancy. It should also include fathers in pregnancy preparation and care, and promote responsible fatherhood. The whole community should also be educated about the importance of good periconception care.

> Good periconception care can prevent some birth defects.

### 2-13 What periconception care can help to prevent birth defects?

1.	**Improve women’s diet**

	Birth defects can be caused by deficiencies of certain essential dietary nutrients (e.g. vitamins and minerals). Increasing the quantity of these nutrients in the diet can prevent certain birth defects. The best known example of a birth defect due to inadequate maternal nutrients is fetal brain damage due to the mother’s diet being deficient in iodine. This can be prevented by adding iodine into the populations’ salt supply (fortification). In South Africa table salt is fortified with iodine.

	Note
	:	Every year about 28 million infants worldwide are born at risk of mild intellectual disability, and 60 000 infants develop severe congenital hypothyroidism (cretinism), due to inadequate amounts of iodine in the mother’s diet.

	Folic acid is another example. Fortifying a staple food with folic acid, or giving folic acid as a pill (supplementation), for three months before and after conception significantly reduces the birth prevalence of neural tube defects. In South Africa, bread and maize meal are fortified with folic acid. Since starting maize meal fortification with folic acid there has been a 30% reduction in the birth prevalence of neural tube defects.

	Diet can also be improved by removing substances that can damage the embryo and fetus (teratogens). The best example is alcohol. Community education to warn women of reproductive age of the dangers of alcohol to the embryo and fetus is necessary.

	> Improving the diet of women reduces the risk of birth defects.

2.	**Avoid and treat maternal infections**

	All children, especially girls, should be immunised against rubella (German measles) as rubella during early pregnancy causes serious birth defects (congenital rubella syndrome).

3.	**Detect and treat maternal health problems**

	Diabetes mellitus and epilepsy are maternal illnesses that can be detected before pregnancy and correctly treated, reducing the risk of birth defects. Avoid drugs which may damage the embryo or fetus (teratogens) such as warfarin, lithium and some anticonvulsants.

> All girls should be immunised against rubella before reaching puberty.

## Medical genetic screening

### 2-14 What is medical genetic screening?

Medical genetic (population) screening uses tests or questions in a population to:

1.	Find people at increased risk of having a particular birth defect.
1.	Find women at increased risk of having a fetus with a birth defect.

Screening tests are not necessarily diagnostic tests.

When identified by a screening test of being at increased risk, individuals can then be offered further tests, if necessary, to confirm the diagnosis, or treatment to prevent or treat the condition. People being screened, including pregnant mothers, will not have presented with complaints or signs of the disorder for which they are screened.

Medical genetic screening can identify pregnant women at an increased risk of having an infant with a specific birth defect, e.g. Down syndrome or neural tube defect. Couples may be screened for being carriers of a common autosomal recessive disorder and therefore of being at increased risk of conceiving a child with the disorder, e.g. sickle cell anaemia and thallasaemia. For other people it detects an increased risk for themselves being affected by a particular birth defect, e.g. congenital hypothyroidism in infants.

> Medical genetic screening is a process undertaken in populations to identify people at increased risk of being affected by, or having a child with, a birth defect.

### 2-15 When can medical genetic screening tests for birth defects be done?

1.	Preconception screening: This is the ideal form of screening and prevention as it allows the parents at risk the greatest range of reproductive choices.
1.	Prenatal (antenatal) screening: This is done once pregnancy is confirmed, late in the first trimester or early in the second trimester. If medical genetic screening during pregnancy for a particular disorder is positive, then further testing may be needed to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. The mother or couple should receive genetic counselling before they consider prenatal diagnosis and again once the result of the prenatal diagnosis is available, especially if the result confirms an abnormality.
1.	Postnatal screening: This is done after birth. Medical genetic screening is done in newborn infants, older children and adults. In the newborn period the most cost-efficient means of screening is for every infant to be physically examined by a trained observer before discharge from hospital or clinic. For example, this will identify most infants with Down syndrome. Blood screening tests can also be done to screen for certain conditions, e.g. congenital hypothyroidism.

Note
:	Preconception screening is used for primary prevention as it prevents a child with a high risk of a birth defect from being conceived. Prenatal screening is used for secondary prevention as the management of a fetus with a birth defect can be planned. Once an infant with a birth defect is born, tertiary prevention consists of early recognition and diagnosis, treatment and genetic counselling to prevent, to the greatest extent possible, deterioration, complications, disability and dependency of the infant with the birth defect.

### 2-16 What medical genetic screening tests for birth defects are available?

All medical genetic screening should be carried out with the full knowledge and understanding of the person being screened. There should be pretest and post-test counselling.

1.	Preconception screening:
	*	Taking a family history.
	*	This is screening by asking questions. Taking and interpreting a three generation family history from women of reproductive age is an inexpensive way of identifying persons with an increased risk of having a child with a birth defect. This could be done in family planning clinics.
	*	Carrier (DNA) screening.
	*	Screening for carriers of common recessive single gene defects is carried out in countries with a high prevalence of these birth defects. The birth defects screened by blood tests include sickle cell anaemia, thalassaemia and cystic fibrosis. This is expensive and is only done in a few countries.
2.	Prenatal screening:
	*	Advanced maternal age screening to identify pregnant women 35 years of age and older. This is done by simply asking all pregnant women their age, and responding appropriately to those women 35 years and older.
	*	Ultrasound screening. Ultrasound screening for Down syndrome can be offered from 11 to 14 weeks gestation and a scan for other congenital abnormalities (such as neural tube and heart defects) between 18 and 23 weeks. Unfortunately, this is not generally available in South Africa due to the lack of necessary equipment and trained staff.
	*	Maternal serum screening. Maternal serum can be tested for different chemicals late in the first trimester (PAPP A and hCG) and early in the second trimester (Triple test) to calculate a risk for a fetus with Down syndrome. Maternal serum can also be used to screen for neural tube defects (alpha fetoprotein). This form of screening is not generally available in South Africa as accurate gestational ageing of the pregnancy with early ultrasound is necessary for the tests to be done.
	*	Rhesus (Rh) blood group screening to identify Rh negative women who may have an infant with neonatal jaundice and anaemia due to blood group incompatibility with her partner.
	*	DNA carrier screening. This can also be carried out on parents during pregnancy, but it is preferable to do this before conception.
3.	Postnatal screening:
	*	Clinical examination of the newborn infant by a trained examiner before discharge from the clinic or hospital. This is unfortunately not done routinely in South Africa.
	*	Newborn screening on cord blood or heel prick blood, e.g. for congenital hypothyroidism. This is only available in a few centres in South Africa.

Note
:	Several birth defects can be screened for using neonate’s blood, from a heel prick, put on Guthrie cards (blotting paper). Birth defects that can be screened for in this manner include sickle cell anaemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital hypothyroidism and inborn errors of metabolism. This is only offered in private practice in South Africa.

### 2-17 Why is medical genetic screening for birth defects not available to everyone in South Africa?

Medical genetic screening can be expensive and requires functioning health systems and infrastructure to be done correctly. Each country must decide on its priorities before establishing these screening services. In South Africa the only antepartum medical genetic screening that is offered to most of the population is for Rhesus blood grouping and syphilis. Advanced maternal age screening could and should be offered. Examination of all newborn infants by a trained examiner before discharge from the clinic or hospital should also be easily done.

### 2-18 What choices does a pregnant woman have if she has an increased screening risk for a birth defect?

If a pregnant woman is shown by genetic screening to be at increased risk for having a fetus with a birth defect, she and her partner should receive careful genetic counselling regarding their specific situation and the options available to them.

This counselling will offer them two choices:

1.	To have prenatal diagnosis: Prenatal pregnancy diagnosis can confirm whether the fetus does or does not have a particular birth defect. This may require invasive procedures such as amniocentesis to obtain fetal cells or amniotic fluid for testing. Amniocentesis involves inserting a thin needle under ultrasound guidance through the abdominal wall into the uterus. There is a small risk that the procedure will cause complications, including a miscarriage. This risk is about 1% with an experienced operator (sonographer). Woman should be informed of this risk so they can include this information in their decision on whether or not to have an amniocentesis.

	Ultrasound examination can also be used to make a prenatal diagnosis. An ultrasound examination is a non-invasive procedure that can be very helpful in identifying structural abnormalities.

	Note
	:	In specific circumstances fetal cells can also be obtained by chorionic villus (placental) biopsy or cordocentesis (drawing blood from the umbilical cord). Both have higher complication risks than amniocentesis and are only offered at a few tertiary centres and in private practice in South Africa.

2.	To continue the pregnancy without prenatal diagnosis: A pregnant woman may decide to take this choice, knowing and understanding the risks of having an infant with a birth defect.

## Parents’ choices with prenatal diagnosis

### 2-19 What choices does a woman have with a confirmed prenatal diagnosis of a birth defect?

Once a pregnant woman, preferably together with her partner, has received careful genetic counselling regarding her specific situation, she should consider the options available to her. It is particularly important that she is given detailed information about the severity of the disability and the mortality risk associated with the specific birth defect. The health-care facilities available to manage an infant born with that particular birth defect must also be known. Only then, can she make a choice of whether to continue with the pregnancy.

Note
:	Any discussion with the parents must be within the limits of the legal terms of reference of the country (Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act 92, 1966 in South Africa). The counselling must be non-directive, not coercive and respect the religious, moral and personal beliefs of the parents. The parents’ decisions are paramount and must be accepted and respected.

## Genetic counselling

### 2-20 What is counselling?

Counselling is a process of education, communication and support by which a counsellor helps a person or people to cope with difficult situations in their lives so that they are able to make important decisions and find realistic ways to solve their problems. Counselling, therefore, helps people to make their own informed decisions and supports their choices, rather than simply telling them what to do.

### 2-21 What is a counsellor?

A counsellor is someone who is trained to educate, assist and give psychosocial support to people with problems. They offer relevant information and discuss options for people to manage their problems and better cope with their lives. This empowers peoples to make their own decisions and take the best course of action according to their personal circumstances, customs, and religious and moral beliefs.

> Counselling is about empowering people to make their own informed decisions and to cope with or solve their own problems.

### 2-22 What important skills are needed to counsel?

Two essential skills are needed for counselling:

1.	A good knowledge of the topic or situation being discussed.
2.	The ability to communicate effectively. Effective communication is the basis of counselling.

### 2-23 What is effective communication?

Communication in counselling is a two-way process in which information, knowledge, thoughts and ideas are passed between the people being counselled and the counsellor. The spoken word is the most important means of communication.

However, the counsellor must be aware that people may also pass important messages by showing their emotions and in their body language (how they act). The counsellor must learn to pick up these signs as it helps in gathering information and giving appropriate understanding (empathy) and emotional support.

Effective communication requires the skill of active listening.

> Effective communication is a combination of active listening and using words with care and consideration.

### 2-24 What is active listening?

Active listening is the process of hearing not only the words people say, but also noting their body language and emotional reactions, and trying to understand the meaning behind their words and actions. In order to understand what a person is saying and to respond appropriately, the counsellor must become skilled in actively listening to people.

### 2-25 What is needed for active listening?

A good listener should:

1.	Put the person being counselled at ease so that they can feel free to talk.
1.	Remove distractions and concentrate on what is being said. Close the door. Do not take phone calls, fiddle with notes or tap your pencil.
1.	Not talk too much. You cannot listen if you keep talking. Be silent when silence is needed. Do not interrupt unnecessarily or finish people’s sentences.
1.	Show interest and empathy.
1.	Try to put yourself in the place of the person being counselled so that you can see and understand the problem from their point of view.
1.	Be patient, and allow and answer questions.

> Active listening is the key to effective counselling.

### 2-26 What else can help effective communication?

1.	Choose your words carefully. Ensure that what you say is what the person being counselled will understand.
1.	Say what you mean and give simple messages.
1.	Remember that as you can receive messages from the person being counselled from their body language, emotional reactions and tone of voice, so can you pass messages to them in the same way. Make sure you pass the ‘right’ message.
1.	Repeat important information and make sure it is understood.

> ‘Words are like medication, they have the ability to heal but their side effects can be harmful.’

### 2-27 What can block effective communication?

1.	Talking more than listening.
1.	Interrupting and arguing.
1.	Being judgemental, critical, threatening or, manipulative.
1.	Being uninterested.
1.	Trying to control the discussion. Communication is a two-way process.
1.	Concentrating only on facts, not feelings.

> ‘If you do not listen to the person being counselled, do not expect them to listen to you.’

### 2-28 What is genetic counselling?

Genetic counselling is an educational process which helps people with a birth defect, or a risk of giving birth to a child with a birth defect, and their families to understand:

1.	The diagnosis (what is the problem).
1.	The cause of the birth defect, including the method of inheritance.
1.	The clinical effects, prognosis and available treatment for the birth defect.
1.	The risks of recurrence of the birth defect in future pregnancies or other family members.
1.	The options for reducing these risks or preventing the birth defect in future pregnancies.

### 2-29 Who can be helped by genetic counselling?

Genetic counselling helps people and their families who are:

1.	Affected by a birth defect.
1.	At risk of inheriting a birth defect.
1.	At risk of passing on a birth defect to their children.
1.	Carrying a fetus with a birth defect.

Genetic counselling assists these people to make their own informed decisions and choices. It also helps them take charge and accept responsibility for coping with and solving situations in their lives that occur because of a birth defect.

> Genetic counselling helps individuals or families who have a birth defect, or are at risk of giving birth to a child with a birth defect, to understand, manage and come to terms with the situation.

### 2-30 How is genetic counselling done?

The main steps in genetic counselling can be remembered by using the word DIAS (i.e. an anagram). DIAS stands for:

1.	**D**efine the problem:

	Confirm a diagnosis, if possible, and identify those issues, related to the diagnosis, concerning the counselled person or persons. Find out from the person or people being counselled what they expect and need from the genetic counselling.

2.	**I**nform:

	Inform fully (educate) the person or the people being counselled about the diagnosis, the cause, the clinical features and the prognosis, the available treatment, genetic risks (risk assessment) and the options for risk reduction or prevention in future pregnancies and family members.

3.	**A**llow people to make their own decisions:

	With the information available to them, the individuals or family should be encouraged to make their own decisions regarding their situation based on to their personal circumstances, customs, religious and moral beliefs (autonomous decision making). These decisions must be accepted and respected by the genetic counsellor, nursing staff and medical team involved in their care.

4.	**S**upport:

	During the genetic counselling process, and thereafter, individuals and family should receive the understanding (empathy), psychological (emotional) and social support they may need or request to enable them to make the necessary decisions and to adjust to their particular circumstances. This may require referring them to other professionals and social agencies.

Note that there are enormous differences between genetic counselling and simply providing information and advice.

A number of different social grants are available for individuals with birth defects in South Africa (as listed in [Addendum B](8.html)).

### 2-31 What are the principles of genetic counselling?

1.	Non-directive education. Therefore the genetic counsellor must:
	*	Have the appropriate information to do the counselling. If not, the counsellor should acquire this information or have the confidence to refer the person or people being counselled to someone with the knowledge.
	*	Make sure the person or people being counselled are fully informed. The counsellor must pass on all the knowledge he or she has on the topic under discussion, including the good and the bad aspects.
	*	Give the necessary information in a language, and at a level of understanding, that the person or people being counselled fully understand.
	*	Give the information to the person or people being counselled in a non-directive manner. This means the information is given in a way that must not influence their future decisions in the direction the counsellor would choose.
2.	Enabling people to decide for themselves. Therefore the genetic counsellor must:
	*	Ensure that each person being counselled must be allowed to make their own decisions. Their choices may be very different from that of the counsellor.
	*	Empower the persons being counselled to make their own decisions.
	*	Respect and accept these decisions, even if they would not be the option chosen by the counsellor, i.e. be non-judgemental. Reassure them that the medical team working with them will also respect and accept their decisions and make sure they continue to get proper care.
3.	Providing support. Therefore the genetic counsellor must:
	*	Encourage people being counselled to express their feelings and needs freely.
	*	Provide non-judgemental communication and support for the individual and family choices and encourage the medical and genetics management team do the same.
	*	Maintain confidentiality within the management team.

### 2-32 What must be known to be able to give genetic counselling?

1.	Who should receive genetic counselling?
2.	The clinical details and natural history of the common birth defects, especially the birth defect on which the patient or parents are being counselled. This includes diagnoses where available, cause, clinical features, prognosis, and available treatment and options for reduction of recurrent risk or prevention.
3.	How to obtain a detailed family history and construct a three-generation family tree.
4.	How to use the family tree to decide on the mode of inheritance for the disorder in the family tree.
5.	How to estimate simple genetic recurrence risks from a family tree.
6.	The details of genetic tests (e.g. chromosomal analysis) and procedures (e.g. amniocentesis) for prenatal and postnatal screening and diagnosis of common birth defects.
7.	Basic counselling skills.
8.	The local, provincial and national resources available for care of individuals with birth defects.
8.	The parent support group facilities available locally, provincially and nationally.

### 2-33 What are the characteristics of a good genetic counsellor?

A good genetic counsellor should:

1.	Be knowledgeable regarding the situation or disorder that is under discussion.
1.	If not knowledgeable, they should be able to get the appropriate information, or have the confidence to refer those being counselled to someone who does have the information.
1.	Be honest.
1.	Have the courage to be able to say ‘I don’t know’. It is not possible to know everything you may need in a given situation. You can always find answers later or refer them to someone who will know.
1.	Be a good listener and good communicator. This helps to build a relationship of trust and acceptance so that feelings can be expressed, even negative or bad ones.
1.	Be respectful of the other person’s feelings and point of view, understanding that every person is an individual who will experience their problem in their own unique way.
1.	Be non-judgemental (do not judge what is right and wrong or place blame).
1.	Be relaxed and calm, i.e. controlled. A counsellor should not become emotionally involved with people receiving counselling.
1.	Be non-directive. This means to give the people being counselled the necessary information they need, and the options they have, in a manner that does not influence, one way or the other, the decisions they have to make.
1.	Be trustworthy and respectful of confidentiality.
1.	Be able to ‘break bad news’.
1.	Be able to support people through their problems, including the normal mourning (grieving) process associated with death or serious problems.
1.	Be patient, caring and understanding.

### 2-34 What are the physical requirements for genetic counselling?

1.	A place with privacy and relative comfort to consult with the people being counselled. There should be as few interruptions as possible (telephones, cellphones, bleepers, noise and people coming in and out).
1.	People being counselled and the counsellor should be able to sit reasonably close so that they can hear and interact with each other but not feel cramped or uncomfortable. Big desks form a barrier between the people involved and prevent easy interaction. Ideally counselling is a ‘round table conference’.
1.	Enough time must be available for the counselling to fully cover the problems being discussed.

### 2-35 Who should provide genetic counselling?

A doctor, genetic-trained nurse or genetic counsellor, provided they are competent and have received appropriate training.

Nursing staff, with appropriate training, have been found to be competent at providing genetic counselling in under-served areas in South Africa. Unfortunately, due to the lack of trained and experienced staff, people needing genetic counselling are often counselled by untrained or poorly trained people.

### 2-36 Who needs genetic counselling?

Any person who is affected by a birth defect, or at risk of inheriting a birth defect, or at risk of passing on a birth defect to their children.

These include:

1.	People with a birth defect.
1.	Parents of a fetus, infant or child with a birth defect.
1.	Parents of an unexplained intrauterine, neonatal or infant death, if this was considered to be due to a birth defect.
1.	People with a family history of a birth defect, who are considering having children.
1.	Couples who are married to a relative, such as a cousin (consanguinity).
1.	People diagnosed as carriers or at risk of being a carrier of a recessive genetic disorder, e.g. haemophilia or oculocutaneous albinism.
1.	Couples diagnosed with an abnormal fetus on ultrasound examination.
1.	Women who have had recurrent pregnancy losses (more than two miscarriages).
1.	Pregnant women, or women who wish to have an infant, where the fetus is at risk of a birth defect because of fetal infection (e.g. rubella), maternal disorders (e.g. diabetes) or teratogens (e.g. alcohol).
1.	Couples identified by prenatal screening who have an increased risk of a birth defect (e.g. advanced maternal age, abnormal ultrasound or a positive maternal serum screening test).

> Any person who is affected by a birth defect, at risk of inheriting a birth defect, or at risk of giving birth to a child with a birth defect should be offered genetic counselling.

## Breaking bad news

### 2-37 Why is breaking bad news about birth defects difficult?

When a woman is pregnant her wish and expectation are for the birth of a normal child. Giving a woman and her partner news about a birth defect causes them great distress. They will have to face loss, including loss of life, health or the possibility of not having a normal child.

People who are faced with loss tend to respond in a manner which can be predicted. Counsellors breaking bad news should be aware of this so that they can assist people through the process.

### 2-38 How do people respond to loss?

People who suffer loss may go through a typical series of reactions. These are:

1.	Denial:

	When faced with bad news involving loss, many people first refuse to believe what they have been told. This is their way of giving themselves time to begin to deal with and understand the terrible news that causes them to feel hopeless and helpless.

2.	Anger:

	Once they realise the news is true; the next reaction may be anger, rage or resentment. This is often directed at other people including family members (e.g. wife or husband, father or mother), friends, medical or nursing staff and even God. It is a defence that people use to protect themselves against despair, and a genetic counsellor must understand this and support the person being counselled through this stage.

3.	Bargaining:

	In this stage, which is usually short, people may try to enter into some sort of bargain with God, to try and reverse or put off feeling the loss.

4.	Depression:

	Eventually, after a person has denied, raged and bargained they begin to realise the great loss they have suffered and this may result in depression. They need to receive acceptance, understanding and empathy, and be given space to freely express their feelings to help them through this period.

5.	Acceptance:

	Eventually the loss is accepted and the person begins to adjust to the changes the loss has brought to their life. At first there is a feeling of numbness which becomes a very sad period. Although this sadness will be overcome and the person will continue with their life, at times in the future they will be reminded of their loss, resulting in sadness or anger once again.

Before reaching acceptance, some people may move forward and backward through the above stages while others may only go through some of the stages.

> The normal response to loss is a sequence of denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.

### 2-39 Can reactions to loss be abnornal?

Yes. Some people have an abnormal grieving (mourning) reaction. They may take too long or not be able to pass from one stage to another, or have an abnormally strong reaction in a particular stage. Thus a person may become stuck in denial and be unable to come to terms with the bad news, have excessive anger, which can damage their relationships with family and friends, or cause them to blame caregivers, or become pathologically depressed.

The genetic counsellor needs to be aware that abnormal grieving reactions can develop, be able to recognise them as early as possible, and refer the person for expert management.

### 2-40 How does a genetic counsellor break bad news?

Genetic counsellors have to use their ability in effective communication to break bad news. Preparing for and breaking bad news is very important because the way this is done may greatly affect the response of the person receiving the news. The counsellor should therefore follow guidelines to try and ensure that this is done in the best possible manner. This should include:

1.	Find a suitable environment for the counselling session.
1.	Decide who should be in the counselling session and ensure everyone is politely introduced.
1.	Establish from the person being counselled their knowledge and understanding of the situation under discussion. Also assess their general level of understanding and awareness so that your discussions will be at a level that is understandable.
1.	If appropriate, assess through careful questioning how much the person wants to know.
1.	Inform the person being counselled of the bad news. Do this carefully and gently, offering small amounts of information at any one time. When people receive bad news they often cannot take in too much information at a time.
1.	Use simple language, leaving out medical terms they will not understand (e.g. trisomy 21 or tetralogy of Fallot) and use teaching aids (e.g. pictures) if necessary.
1.	Every now and then check to see if they understand what is being told to them.
1.	Be prepared and willing to repeat information one or more times.
1.	Answer questions to the best of your ability, and never be afraid to say that you do not know. Answers can be found later or you can refer them to someone who will know.
1.	Write down the main points or give them prepared written information about the birth defect so that they can read and think about the information later.

End the counselling session with an open invitation to those being counselled to contact the genetic counsellor with any further queries, need for psychosocial support or for further genetic counselling they require. Provide them with contact particulars.

## Case study 1

A woman who is one month pregnant, and has a three-year-old child with a birth defect, visits her family doctor and asks if anything can be done to find out whether her fetus has the same birth defect. After taking a careful family history, the doctor draws a three-generation family tree.

### 1. How can birth defects be screened for during pregnancy?

*	Older women (35 years or older) are at an increased risk of having a fetus with birth defects, especially Down syndrome. All pregnant women should be asked their age when pregnancy is confirmed. If 35 years or older they should be counselled and offered genetic screening and prenatal diagnosis (amniocentesis) when indicated.
*	Ultrasound scanning late in the first trimester and then again between 18–23 weeks gestation can screen many birth defects.
*	Maternal serum tests can be used to screen for Down syndrome (late first trimester) and neural tube defects (early second trimester).
*	All pregnant women should be screened for their Rhesus blood group so that haemolytic disease of the newborn can be avoided.

### 2. What can be done before pregnancy to reduce the risk of child with birth defects?

The risk of having a child with birth defects can sometimes be reduced with basic reproductive health approaches, such as family planning (deciding not to conceive) and periconception care.

### 3. What is periconception care?

This is the care of women before conception and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, which may reduce the risk of birth defects. It aims for optimal health care for women before conception and in early pregnancy to increase the chance of a normal infant.

### 4. Give examples of how periconception care can prevent birth defects?

*	Improve the woman’s diet by food supplementation or fortification. In South Africa iodine fortification of table salt can prevent fetal brain damage due to iodine deficiency while folic acid fortification of maize meal has reduced neural tube defects by 30%.
*	Avoid dangerous substances in the diet such as alcohol.
*	Make sure that all women are immunised against rubella before they reach childbearing age.
*	Detect and correctly treat maternal illnesses such as diabetes and epilepsy.
*	Make sure that any medication taken is safe for the fetus.

### 5. What are supplementation and fortification?

Essential substances, such as folic acid and iodine, can be added to food in the diet (fortification) or can be taken separately as a pill, tablet or capsule (supplementation). Folic acid and iodine are often provided as either fortification or supplementation.

### 6. What is a three-generation family tree?

This is a drawing (a pedigree) of three generations of that family showing normal individuals and those who have a birth defect or are carriers of a birth defect.

### 7. What is the value of a three-generation family tree?

It helps to identify patterns of inheritance of a birth defect, e.g. autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive. This makes it easier to predict whether a birth defect is likely to occur in a given pregnancy.

## Case study 2

Parents who plan a family are concerned about the possibility of having a child with birth defects. They speak to friends and say they have heard about medical genetic screening for birth defects but do not know what the term means.

### 1. What is medical genetic screening?

MedicaI genetic screening, or population screening, is a system that uses questions or tests in a community to identify individuals at increased risk of having a birth defect or a woman having a child with a birth defect.

### 2. What is the importance of identifying people at increased risk?

They can be offered further tests to confirm whether or not they, or their fetus, have the birth defect or are likely to pass the problem on to their children.

### 3. Do these people not already have signs of the clinical condition?

No. This is why they need to be identified by a screening method.

### 4. What is the importance of being identified as having a birth defect or possibly passing a genetic defect on to one’s children?

Prevention or treatment can be offered to these people. For example, they may decide not to have children if there is a high chance that their children may be affected by a serious genetic defect, such as cystic fibrosis. On the other hand, the infant could be offered treatment for a condition, such as haemophilia, before it presents with serious complications.

### 5. When can screening be done to prevent birth defects?

*	Before conception (preconception screening).
*	During pregnancy (prenatal screening).
*	After delivery (postnatal screening).

### 6. Can you give an example of each?

*	Before conception – DNA carrier screening for common single gene defects, e.g. cystic fibrosis.
*	During pregnancy – Early ultrasound scanning or maternal serum screening for Down syndrome.
*	After delivery – blood screening for congenital hypothyroidism.

## Case study 3

A nurse wants to train as a genetic counsellor. She speaks to the tutor of a genetic counselling course to find out more about counselling. She also reads a book about caring for parents of children with birth defects.

### 1. What is genetic counselling?

It is a process of education, communication and support which helps people with a birth defect or who are at risk of giving birth to a child with a birth defect. It enables them to understand the diagnosis, cause, method of inheritance, clinical effects, prognosis and treatment and risk of recurrence of the birth defect.

### 2. How is genetic counselling provided?

The main goals of a genetic counsellor are:

*	Defining the problem.
*	Informing and educating.
*	Allowing people to make their own decisions.
*	Supporting them.

Remember ‘DIAS’.

### 3. Why is counselling more than simply giving good advice?

During counselling, people are educated about their problems, receive options for managing the situation and are empowered to try and understand their problem and then make the best informed decision for themselves. They are helped to come to terms with their situation and solve the problems that occur.

### 4. What essential skill does a genetic counsellor need?

They should be able to communicate well with people. Active listening is particularly important.

### 5. What is active listening?

It is the ability to hear not only the words people say but also note and interpret their body language and emotional reactions. This helps to understand the meaning behind their words.

### 6. What are common mistakes, which may prevent active listening?

*	Talking more than listening.
*	Interrupting and arguing.
*	Being judgemental.
*	Concentrating only on facts and not also feelings.

### 7. What are the expected normal responses to loss?

*	Denial.
*	Anger.
*	Bargaining.
*	Depression.
*	Acceptance.

# Down syndrome

Before you begin this unit, please take the corresponding test to assess your knowledge of the subject matter. You should redo the test after you’ve worked through the unit, to evaluate what you have learned.

## Objectives

When you have completed this unit you should be able to:

*	Define Down syndrome.
*	Understand the causes of Down syndrome.
*	Explain the risk factors for Down syndrome.
*	List the clinical features and complications of Down syndrome.
*	Plan the care of a child with Down syndrome.
*	Understand how the risk of having a child with Down syndrome can be reduced.
*	Recognise an infant or child with Down syndrome.
*	Describe how Down syndrome can be diagnosed antenatally.

## Introduction to Down syndrome

### 3-1 What is Down syndrome?

Down syndrome is the name given to a recognisable pattern of clinical features. Signs of Down syndrome include a typical facial appearance, intellectual disability, hypotonia (floppiness), congenital heart defects and other birth defects. These children can be recognised as they all have a similar physical appearance.

> Individuals with Down syndrome can be recognised clinically.

Down syndrome is the correct term for this condition although it is often called Down’s syndrome. The old terms ‘Mongol’ and mongolism are not acceptable and are no longer used. Down syndrome is a typical example of a chromosomal disorder.

Note
:	The syndrome was first described in 1866 by Dr Langdon Down in London. A genetic syndrome is a collection of clinical features and birth defects that can be recognised as being a consistent pattern.

### 3-2 How common is Down syndrome?

Down syndrome occurs in all communities and ethnic groups. In many developing (low resourced) countries the birth prevalence (number of affected infants/1000 live birth) is 2 to 3 per 1000 live births. In industrialised (high income) countries, the birth prevalence is less than 1.5/1000 live births.

In South Africa the birth prevalence of Down syndrome is 2.1/1000 live births in the Limpopo Province (a poor rural area) and 1.8/1000 in Soweto (a more developed urban area).

The prevalence (number of affected infants and children per 1000 children in the community) falls rapidly in developing countries as many affected children die in infancy or early childhood. For example, in Limpopo Province the prevalence of Down syndrome in children aged two to nine years is only 0.74/1000, indicating that 65% of affected children have already died by two years of age.

> The birth prevalence of Down syndrome in South Africa is about two per 1000 live births.

### 3-3 Why is the birth prevalence of Down syndrome higher in developing countries?

The risk of a woman having an infant with Down syndrome increases as she gets older. It is especially high once she reaches 35 years. Advanced maternal age (AMA) is the term used to describe pregnant women of 35 years or older.

In developing countries a higher percentage of pregnant women are of advanced maternal age. They also often do not have access to, or use, family planning (contraception), prenatal screening, prenatal diagnosis, genetic counselling and selective termination of pregnancy. As a result the birth prevalence of Down syndrome is high.

The exception is China. Because of their one child per family policy, women usually choose to have their child between 25 and 27 years of age when the risk of Down syndrome is low. Therefore, the birth prevalence of Down syndrome in China is the lowest in the world at less than 1/1000 live births.

In industrialised countries, women are aware of their increased risk of having a child with Down syndrome. Therefore, most use family planning and choose not to fall pregnant once they reach 35 years of age. This lowers the percentage of pregnant women of advanced maternal age and, therefore, reduces the birth prevalence of Down syndrome in these countries.

Note
:	In industrialised countries the percentage of women of advanced maternal age dropped between 1950 and 1980 with the introduction of oral contraception. With this the birth prevalence of Down syndrome dropped from 2.5 to less than 1.5/1000 live births. In the last 20 years more women are having children at an advanced age as they choose to have their families late for social reasons. Because they have access to, and use, genetic services the birth prevalence of Down syndrome has remained low.

> The risk of having an infant with Down syndrome increases with advanced maternal age.

Note
:	The risk of Down syndrome more than doubles between 30 and 35 years of age from 1/965 (approximately 1/1000) to 1/386 (approximately 2.6/1000.

### 3-4 Are most infants with Down syndrome born to older women?

Yes. In most developing countries where a higher percentage of pregnant women are of advanced maternal age, most infants with Down syndrome are born to older mothers. In addition, services for prenatal screening, prenatal diagnosis, genetic counselling and selective termination of pregnancy are often not available. For example, in South Africa more than half of infants with Down syndrome infants are born to mother aged 35 years or older.

In industrialised countries, where women use contraception and have access to genetic services, a lower percentage of mothers are of advanced maternal age and most infants with Down syndrome (above 60%) are born to mothers under 35 years of age.

### 3-5 Is Down syndrome well known in all communities?

In industrialised countries, Down syndrome is well publicised so that most members of the community know about the condition. In contrast, the condition is not well known in many developing communities, who may not even have a local name for the condition.

The lack of awareness of Down syndrome in many rural communities in South Africa results in many affected children being undiagnosed. This situation is improving with education to inform health-care workers and the community about Down syndrome.

Note
:	In the early 1990s in Gauteng Province only 3% of mothers of infants with Down syndrome were aware of the condition before the birth of their infant. By 1997, due to education of the community and medical and nursing staff, 47% of mothers presenting for advanced maternal age counselling knew of Down syndrome.

### 3-6 What is the cause of Down syndrome?

Down syndrome is the commonest chromosomal disorder in live born infants. It is caused by extra material from chromosome 21 being present in the body’s cells. Individuals with Down syndrome usually have three, instead of the normal two, chromosomes 21 in all body cells. This is called trisomy 21 (‘tri’ means three) … because of the extra chromosome 21, each cell now has a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. An extra chromosome 21 (non-disjunction resulting in trisomy 21) is the cause of Down syndrome in more than 95% of affected children. The risk of recurrence is low.

> Down syndrome is caused by the presence of extra chromosome 21 material in the cells of the body.

About 3% of infants with Down syndrome do not have a whole extra chromosome 21 but an extra piece of a chromosome 21 is added (translocated) onto another chromosome. The total number of chromosomes is therefore normal at 46 (but one of the chromosomes looks longer than usual as it has an extra piece of a chromosome 21). This is called translocation Down syndrome. This may occur for the first time (a new mutation) or be inherited from a parent who is a balanced translocation carrier. If inherited then the parents have a high risk in future pregnancies for further children with translocation Down syndrome.

In the other 2% of infants with Down syndrome, only some of their body cells have an extra chromosome 21. This is known as mosaicism. It has the lowest risk for recurrence in future pregnancies.

> Down syndrome is almost always caused by trisomy 21.

The appearance of children with Down syndrome is the same whether the extra chromosome 21 material is due to trisomy, translocation or mosaicism.

### 3-7 How does trisomy 21 occur?

Trisomy 21 (having an extra chromosome 21) is caused by non-disjunction. This is an unequal sharing of the 46 chromosomes when forming the ova (eggs) or sperms (i.e. the gametes) before fertilisation. In this division, each ovum or sperm should get 23 chromosomes. However, in non-disjunction this division is incorrect. The chromosomes 21 pair do not separate, as they should. Instead, one gamete (ovum or sperm) gets two chromosomes 21, while the other gets none. In trisomy 21, usually the ovum, with two copies of chromosome 21 (instead of one), is fertilised by a normal sperm with one copy of chromosome 21. As a result, the zygote (the fertilised cell from which the embryo and fetus will develop) now has three copies of chromosome 21 (instead of two) with a total of 47 chromosomes.

Note
:	Down syndrome usually occurs because of non-disjunction in the ovum of the mother (80%). However, in 20% of people with Down syndrome the non-disjunction takes place in the father, and it is the sperm that has the extra chromosome 21.

### 3-8 How can one recognise a person with Down syndrome?

Infants, children and adults with Down syndrome, throughout the world, have a similar appearance. They have clinical features which can be recognised. However, the clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome is frequently missed in infants in South Africa. To prevent this, the clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome must be based on a complete history and physical examination, and not just looking for the facial typical appearance. The clinical diagnosis should be confirmed by a blood test.

Note
:	In South Africa, research shows that only 16% of newborn infants with Down syndrome are diagnosed by health-care workers in the hospital or clinic after delivery. Less than 50% of infants with Down syndrome are diagnosed before six months of age, even though they have attended clinics for their immunisations.

### 3-9 What are the main recognisable features of Down syndrome?

The main clinical features of Down syndrome are:

1.	Hypotonia (floppy infant).
1.	A typical facial appearance.
1.	Poor sucking and feeding.
1.	Abnormalities of the hands and feet.
1.	Poor Moro reflex.
1.	Developmental delay (poor head control with head lag, slow to sit when propped up, and unable to bear weight on legs).
1.	Intellectual disability.
1.	Signs of congenital heart defects.
1.	Growth restriction with short stature (stunting).
1.	A small penis.

### 3-10 What are the typical facial appearances of a person with Down syndrome?

There are a number of abnormalities seen in the face, head and neck of a person with Down syndrome.

1.	Face:
	*	A small, round, flat face.
	*	Upward slanting eyes with epicanthic folds (prominent skin folds at the inner corner of the eyelids).
	*	A flat nasal bridge.
	*	Relatively big tongue and small, open mouth. Therefore, the tongue often protrudes (sticks out of the mouth).
2.	Head:
	*	The head is round with a flat occiput (back of the head). This is called brachycephaly.
	*	The head circumference is often smaller than normal.
	*	The ears are small and may be malformed and low set.
3.	Neck:
	*	The neck is short.
	*	Skin over the back of the neck is loose, forming folds.

> Children with Down syndrome all look alike.

### 3-11 What are the typical features of the hands of a person with Down syndrome?

Infants, children and adults with Down syndrome all have hands that look alike and can easily be recognised. The typical hand appearance includes:

1.	Short, broad hands with short stubby fingers (brachydactyly).
1.	Most have a single palmar crease on one or both hands.
1.	They often have short, incurved small fingers (clinodactyly) and may only have a single crease on their little finger.

### 3-12 What are the typical features of the feet of a person with Down syndrome?

Infants, children and adults with Down syndrome also have feet that look alike. The typical features are:

1.	They are short and broad, similar to the hands.
1.	A wide gap between the large and second toe is common (sandal gap).
1.	A crease extending from the sandal gap towards the heel is common. This may not be obvious in children who do not wear shoes.

> People with Down syndrome have short, broad hands and feet.

### 3-13 What are the signs of hypotonia in an infant with Down syndrome?

Infants with Down syndrome are floppy (hypotonic) and have a poor Moro reflex. Obvious floppiness (hypotonia) is most marked during the first months of life. There is head lag and usually an incomplete Moro reflex. Hypotonia is the most consistent sign in Down syndrome. When handled, infants feel like a rag doll. Mothers often complain when their infants reach four months of age and still do not have head or neck control. As children with Down syndrome grow older the hypotonia becomes less obvious.

> All newborn infants with Down syndrome have hypotonia.

### 3-14 Why do infants with Down syndrome feed poorly?

Infants with Down syndrome often have feeding difficulties during the first weeks of life. They feed slowly with a poor suck and have difficulty swallowing due to the relatively big tongue. Feeds may have to be given by tube or cup at first before they can breastfeed adequately. Their hypotonia and frequent blocked nose contribute to the feeding problems. However, over the weeks their feeding improves. Heart failure, caused by congenital heart defects, may also cause poor feeding, and needs to be treated.

> Poor feeding is common in infants with Down syndrome.

### 3-15 Are all people with Down syndrome intellectually disabled?

Down syndrome is the commonest genetic cause of developmental delay and intellectual disability. The milestones of infants and children with Down syndrome are slow, co-ordination is poor, and language and social development are delayed. They are all intellectually disabled to a greater or lesser degree. However, the degree of intellectual disability varies widely. With early and appropriate encouragement and stimulation, the level of intellectual disability can be improved. These children can then be mainstreamed into normal schools, although their progress will be slow and they will need special attention. When children with special needs, such as Down syndrome, are put in normal schools rather than special schools, this is called ‘inclusion’. Whenever possible, this is the educational policy in South Africa.

As adults, people with Down syndrome work well and some may find work in the open labour market or in sheltered employment. South Africa’s new labour laws promote the employment of people with disability.

Unfortunately, the degree of impaired learning disability has been exaggerated in the past when little effort was made to encourage these children to reach their developmental potential. With late or little stimulation, intellectual disability is often severe, further disadvantaging them and hindering their integration into society.

> All people with Down syndrome have some degree of intellectual disability.

Note
:	The term intellectual disability is preferred to mental retardation.

### 3-16 What is the pattern of growth in infants with Down syndrome?

Most South African newborns with Down syndrome are born at term (37 to 42 weeks) and have an average birth weight of 2700 g, which is less than normal, and a sign that their fetal growth is slower than usual. After birth, infants and children with Down syndrome continue to grow slowly and remain shorter than normal (stunted). Weight gain is slow in the first months and years but many children with Down syndrome later become obese. Obesity remains a problem in adolescence and adulthood.

Note
:	Older children with Down syndrome in rural areas tend not to be obese. This is because the supply of food is limited and they get adequate exercise as they have to share the family and household chores.

### 3-17 Who usually makes the clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome?

The diagnosis should be made by the nurses or doctors caring for the infant after delivery. However, the clinical features can be difficult to recognise in the first few days of life. Some mothers are first to notice that their newborn infants do not appear normal or have problems. If the mother is concerned, the infant must be examined carefully.

The way to identify infants and children with Down syndrome is to make sure you know and can recognise their clinical features. Always look for Down syndrome, especially in infants and children of older mothers and infants who are floppy. Take a full history and complete a general examination, being certain to look for hypotonia, a poor Moro reflex, and abnormalities of the hands and feet. Confirm the diagnosis with a blood test.

### 3-18 How is the clinical diagnosis of Down synfrome confirmed?

By taking a sample of venous blood which must be added to a specially prepared test tube. This is then sent to a genetic laboratory where a chromosomal analysis will be performed. It is important that the correct test tube is obtained and the test arranged with the laboratory before the blood sample is taken.

The parents must be fully counselled and their consent obtained before arranging a chromosomal analysis. It is very important to confirm the clinical diagnosis and identify the chromosome pattern (karyotype) to determine whether the Down syndrome is due to non-disjunction, translocation or mosaicism.

> A chromosome analysis on a blood sample is used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome.

### 3-19 When should parents be told the diagnosis of Down syndrome?

It is important to tell the parents the diagnosis as soon as possible. The manner in which they are told and counselled has a major effect on the way they accept the diagnosis. With careful examination, most infants with Down syndrome should be diagnosed at birth or shortly thereafter.

## The complications of Down syndrome

### 3-20 What are the major complications of Down syndrome in children?

1.	Congenital malformations: Almost 50% of infants with Down syndrome have a major congenital malformation. These are a frequent cause of early death.
1.	Recurrent infections: Children with Down syndrome have poor functioning of the immune system. This causes recurrent infection, especially of the upper respiratory tract and lungs (pneumonia). Pneumonia is worsened by a poor ability to cough due to the hypotonia. Pneumonia is a common cause of death in children with Down syndrome, especially in the first few years of life.
1.	Visual problems: Squint, nystagmus (horizontal or vertical jerky movements of the eyes) and short or long sightedness are common. Cataracts are less common. Many children with Down syndrome need to wear glasses.
1.	Hearing problems: This is most often caused by repeated middle ear infections with fluid behind the ear drum (in the middle ear).
1.	Hypothyroidism: This can occur at any age in a person with Down syndrome and is difficult to diagnose. Routine testing at birth, six months of age and then yearly thereafter should be done to screen for hypothyroidism.

> Almost 50% of infants with Down syndrome have a major congenital malformation.

Note
:	Myeloid leukaemia and an unstable cervical joint in the neck are rare but important complications of Down syndrome. They often also have early onset Alzheimer’s disease as young adults (as early as 25 to 30 years).

### 3-21 What congenital malformations are important complications of Down syndrome in the newborn infant?

1.	Congenital heart defects: About 45% of infants with Down syndrome have congenital heart defects. They may present with features of heart failure, recurrent pneumonia, failure to thrive or cyanosis (blue). Some are detected when a heart murmur is heard during routine clinical examination.
1.	Duodenal atresia: These infants have an obstruction in the duodenum (between the outlet of the stomach and the start of the small intestine). They vomit their feeds in the first few days of life and the vomitus is often bile stained. The diagnosis can be confirmed on an abdominal X-ray, by the presence of what is called a ‘double bubble’ (the dilated stomach and upper duodenum). They must be urgently transferred for corrective surgery.

Both duodenal atresia and some congenital heart defects can be diagnosed by antenatal ultrasound examination.

### 3-22 Which are the commonest congenital heart defects in infants with Down syndrome?

The commonest congenital heart defects that occur in infants with Down syndrome include:

1.	Endocardial cushion defect: (a hole between the atria and ventricles of the heart). The commonest congenital heart defects in infants and children with Down syndrome are endocardial cushion defects.
1.	Ventricular septal defect: (VSD – a hole in the wall which separates the two ventricles, the lower two chambers of the heart). This may be small, which causes little or no clinical problems and closes without treatment in the first year of life. However, it may be large, causing severe problems in the first weeks of life, including heart failure, repeated episodes of pneumonia and failure to thrive. In these children, medical and possibly surgical treatment is indicated.
1.	Atrial septal defect: (ASD – a hole in the wall between the atria, the upper two chambers of the heart).
1.	Tetralogy of Fallot: This is a complex heart defect in which the child is cyanosed (blue).

Congenital heart defects are the commonest cause of death in infants and children with Down syndrome. Therefore, all newborn infants with Down syndrome must be carefully examined for signs of congenital heart defects.

> Congenital heart defects are the commonest cause of death in children with Down syndrome.

Note
:	Endocardial cushion, ventricular septal and atrial septal defects result in excessive blood flow through the lungs. These congested, oedematous lungs are very susceptible to infections, which are often the cause of death if not correctly treated.

### 3-23 What is the life expectancy of children with Down syndrome?

The life expectancy varies widely between different countries. In developing countries, most children with Down syndrome die during infancy and early childhood from infections and congenital heart defects. In South Africa 65% of infants and young children with Down syndrome die before the age of two years. In contrast, most children with Down syndrome in industrialised countries can be expected to survive into adulthood, with many living between 50 to 60 years of age. Young women with Down syndrome are usually fertile while males are usually infertile. Contraception for them is very important. They have a 50% chance of having an infant with Down syndrome.

## Caring for children with Down syndrome

### 3-24 What care is available for infants and children with Down syndrome?

Infants and children with Down syndrome, as with all people with congenital disability, should be offered the ‘best possible care’ available for their problems and special needs. This care includes:

1.	**Diagnosis**

	For infants and children with Down syndrome, as with all persons with birth defects, it is important to make and confirm a diagnosis as early as possible. This allows for early genetic counselling to inform parents about the disorder, its cause and available treatment. It also helps families come to terms with the condition, and accept and bond with their child. This will encourage the parents to begin early treatment and stimulation programmes, to enable the child to reach his or her best long-term potential for health, development and intellectual ability.

2.	**Medical treatment**
	*	Infants and children with Down syndrome have many problems that require medical treatment. Some of these treatments can be offered in primary health-care facilities. Heart failure from congenital heart defects can be diagnosed and treated with anti-failure drugs (digoxin, diuretics and potassium chloride). The child may need referral for special investigations to confirm the cardiac diagnosis and to plan surgery if necessary and available.
	*	Recurrent infections should be treated early and vigorously with antibiotics. Iron and multivitamin supplements should also be prescribed.
	*	Infants and children with Down syndrome should be tested for hypothyroidism, and treated if necessary.
	*	Children with Down syndrome who have congenital heart defects need protection against bacterial endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) after dental care or surgery. They must receive prophylactic antibiotics before and after these procedures.
	*	All infants and children with Down syndrome should receive routine immunisations.

3.	**Surgical treatment**
	*	Surgical repair for some congenital heart defects may be available in paediatric cardiac units.
	*	Infants and children with Down syndrome who have visual problems, including squint, nystagmus, cataracts and poor vision, should be referred for an ophthalmological (eye) assessment.
	*	Infants and children with Down syndrome who have other congenital malformations like duodenal atresia will need surgical correction of these problems. Boys with Down syndrome often have undescended testes, which may need surgery if undescended after age two years.
4.	**Neurodevelopmental therapy and community-based rehabilitation**

	This is a very important part of caring for children with Down syndrome.

4.	**Genetic counselling and psychosocial support**

Note
:	The World Health Organisation has recognised that, given the different circumstances of each country, the levels of care available for people with congenital disability may differ. However, they consider that at all times the ‘best possible patient care’ in the circumstances must be offered. The rights of all people with disability are protected in the Constitution of South Africa.

### 3-25 How can infants and children with Down syndrome be helped to reach their full developmental and intellectual potential?

Infants and children with Down syndrome develop slowly and all are intellectually disabled to some degree. It has been proved that infants and children with Down syndrome who receive good early neurodevelopment therapy, love and stimulation from their parents at home, have a better intellectual outcome (IQ) than those put in institutions or neglected. The earlier they receive intervention and stimulation, the better the results.

Every effort must be made to keep the child with Down syndrome in the home with their families so that they can be given the opportunity of fulfilling their emotional, health and educational needs.

Neurodevelopmental therapy includes the following:

1.	Physiotherapy is very useful for infants who are floppy and have slow motor milestones. It helps these infants and young children to achieve their motor milestones faster. For the best result, referral as young as possible is recommended.
1.	Hearing assessment (audiology) and speech therapy are important for infants and children with Down syndrome as they have delayed speech development. This is worsened by recurrent ear infections which may cause hearing loss. If deafness is suspected, a hearing assessment should be done. Speech therapy helps the development of better speech. Again, early referral gives the best results.
1.	Occupational therapy can improve fine motor co-ordination as well as personal and social development. Early assessment and therapy give the best results.

All these forms of neurodevelopmental therapy are available in major centres. However, in both rural and urban areas regions with fewer resources, hospitals may only have a physiotherapist and/or an occupational therapist. A few may also have a community-based rehabilitation programme.

In South Africa, rehabilitation for infants and children with disabilities, including Down syndrome, can be assisted by the use of a locally produced stimulation programme called START (Strive Towards Achieving Results Together). This was designed to use cheap, locally available materials and can be offered by trained local community members. This programme is of great benefit to infants and children with Down syndrome.

## Prevention

### 3-26 Can Down syndrome be prevented?

Yes. There are two approaches for the prevention of Down syndrome. These are:

1.	Primary prevention by trying to stop infants with Down syndrome being conceived. This pre-conception approach is the preferred method of prevention. It is based on the knowledge that the risk of having an infant with Down syndrome is greatest in women of 35 years of age or more. If women are made aware of Down syndrome and have access to family planning and contraception, they have the option of completing their families before the age of 35 years. In South Africa, up to 50% of Down syndrome pregnancies could be prevented in this manner.
2.	Prevention based on genetic screening, prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome and genetic counselling. All women aged 35 years or more should be offered screening. Ideally screening should be made available for all pregnant women.

> Down syndrome can be prevented before conception by community education and family planning, and in the antenatal period by prenatal screening, diagnosis and genetic counselling.

## Screening for Down syndrome

### 3-27 How can Down syndrome be screened for during pregnancy?

Screening tests can identify the risk a woman has of carrying an infant with Down syndrome but cannot make a confident diagnosis. There are a number of methods which can identify pregnant women at high risk of having an infant with Down syndrome.

1.	By identifying all pregnant women of advanced maternal age:

	This should be done at the first antenatal visit when pregnancy is first confirmed. Women aged 35 years or more, and before 24 weeks gestation, should be offered genetic counselling, regarding their increased risk for an infant with Down syndrome, and the possibility of prenatal diagnosis, early in pregnancy. Identifying women of advanced maternal age is currently the only form of screening test for Down syndrome that can be offered to all women in South Africa. Unfortunately it is still not being done in many parts of the country.

2.	First trimester ultrasound examination of the fetus:

	This is best performed at 12 weeks of gestation (between 11 and 13 weeks). The thickness of the skin over the back of the fetal neck is measured. The skin thickness is usually increased with Down syndrome. As the ultrasonographer needs special training and expensive equipment, ultrasound screening is only available to a limited number of women in South Africa. Ultrasound screening is useful but will not detect all cases of Down syndrome. About 70% of fetuses with Down syndrome can be detected by ultrasound examination. Eleven to 13 weeks is also the best time to accurately determine gestational age by ultrasound examination. Other birth defects associated with Down syndrome may also be detected.

	Note
	:	Increased thickness of the skin over the back of the neck is due to a collection of fluid (oedema) and is called increased nuchal translucency. This is strongly associated with a number of chromosomal abnormalities, especially Down syndrome. It is best to screen for nuchal translucency between 11 and 13 weeks gestation.

3.	Second trimester ultrasound examination of the fetus:

	Fetal ultrasound screening for major congenital malformations is ideally offered at 18 to 20 weeks gestation. It may detect malformations associated with Down syndrome. Second trimester ultrasound is not commonly available in South Africa.

4.	Maternal serum screening during early pregnancy (the triple test):

	This is best done at 16 weeks (between 15 and 18 weeks) and requires that the gestational age is accurately known and confirmed by ultrasound examination. In the triple test, the concentrations of three biochemical compounds are measured in the mother’s blood. The test results, together with the gestational age and the maternal age, are entered into a computer program to generate a risk for the fetus having Down syndrome. The triple test is not generally available in the state sector in South Africa.

	Note
	:	If the fetus has Down syndrome, the concentration of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and unconjugated oestriol (uE3) tend to be decreased and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) increased. An open neural tube defect will also result in a raised AFP.

5.	Maternal serum and ultrasound screening combined in the first trimester:

	This is best done at 12 weeks (11–13 weeks). The concentrations of two biochemical compounds in the mother’s blood (PPAP-A and hCG) and the thickness of the skin over the back of the fetal neck are measured. Together with maternal age, these tests can detect up to 85% of fetuses affected with Down syndrome if entered into a computer program. This is the most accurate form of screening for Down syndrome but only offered in private practice.

Screening tests are very useful in identifying women at high risk of having a fetus with Down syndrome. Unfortunately most of the tests are not available in the state sector in South Africa. There is a great need to make these screening tests widely available to all women.

Note
:	If the fetus has Down syndrome the concentration of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP A) is decreased and hCG is increased. The false positive rate with combination screening is about 5%.

> Screening tests are very useful to identify women at high risk of having a fetus with Down syndrome.

### 3-28 What should be done if prenatal screening indicates a high risk of Down syndrome?

If there is an increased risk for Down syndrome on genetic screening (advanced maternal age, ultrasound, maternal serum screening or a combinations of these), then the mother (preferably with her partner) should be counselled and offered prenatal diagnosis with amniocentesis at 16 weeks to confirm or exclude the possible diagnosis of Down syndrome. A risk of above one in 250 is often used to define a high risk for Down syndrome.

Note
:	Fetal cells can also be obtained by chorionic villus (placental) biopsy or cordocentesis (drawing blood from the umbilical cord). Both have higher complication risks than amniocentesis and are only offered at a few tertiary centres and in private practice in South Africa.

### 3-29 What investigations can confirm or exclude the diagnosis of Down syndrome?

When the risk of Down syndrome is increased, the diagnosis of Down syndrome can be confirmed in 48 to 72 hours using FISH (Fluorescent In-situ Hybridisation) or PCR-aneuploidy tests. These tests detect an abnormal number of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y.

Chromosomal analysis will also confirm or exclude the diagnosis of Down syndrome and can tell the difference between trisomy, translocation or mosaicism

## Genetic counselling for Down syndrome

### 3-30 What genetic counselling is needed by parents who have a child with Down syndrome?

Genetic counselling is a very important part of the care of people with Down syndrome and their family, especially the parents and siblings. The parents need to be educated and informed about:

1.	The diagnosis.
1.	The cause of Down syndrome. They need to know that Down syndrome is a genetic disorder, caused in 95% of cases, by an extra chromosome 21 (trisomy 21). The risk of this happening is greater in women of 35 years or more.
1.	The clinical features, complications and prognosis of Down syndrome. Also what treatment is available.
1.	The increased risk for parents of a child with Down syndrome having another child with Down syndrome in future pregnancies. They need to know their options for reducing this risk by genetic screening and for preventing the birth of another affected child by genetic screening and prenatal diagnosis.

The parents, family and child with Down syndrome need to be offered on-going psychosocial support, as with all individuals who have a congenital disability. They suffer lifelong problems that require lifelong care. The burden of the disorder and the care is experienced not only by the affected person, but also the family, especially parents, brothers and sisters.

### 3-31 Where can parents, who have a child with Down syndrome, get support?

Support, help and reassurance may be obtained from:

1.	Doctors, nurses (especially genetic-trained nursing staff), genetic counsellors and neurodevelopmental therapists.
1.	Teachers in special schools for the intellectually disabled.
1.	Social workers.
1.	The Down Syndrome Association and other support groups play an important role in South Africa in helping persons and their families with Down syndrome. They are involved in educating the public, as well as medical and para-medical professions. They also play a major advocacy role for people with intellectual disability, including Down syndrome.

*[Addendum C](9.html) lists the addresses and contact details of the regional offices of the Down Syndrome Association in South Africa.*

### 3-32 What is the risk of a woman, with one child with Down syndrome, having another child with Down syndrome?

This depends on the chromosomal diagnosis of the first child with Down syndrome, i.e. whether the child has trisomy 21, a translocation or mosaicism.

The risk for a woman less than 35 years old with an infant or child with trisomy 21 having an affected infant in future pregnancies is 1 in 100 (1%). If the woman is 35 or more years old, the risk is related to her age and is given as slightly higher than her age-related risk. In future pregnancies she should be offered amniocentesis.

If the child has a translocation involving an extra piece of chromosome 21, then the risk can vary greatly and be very high (100% recurrence risk in some cases), depending on the type of translocation. Therefore, a chromosome analysis for both parents needs to be known to be able to counsel them correctly. A counsellor with proper training and experience should do the counselling.

The risk for recurrence of mosaic Down syndrome is 1%.

### 3-33 What choices does a pregnant woman have if she has an increased risk for an infant with Down syndrome?

If a pregnant woman is at increased risk for having a child with Down syndrome, she and her partner should receive genetic counselling. This counselling should fully inform them of what the risks are and the choices available to them. These include:

1.	To have prenatal diagnosis. This will require an amniocentesis to be done to get fetal cells on which to perform chromosomal analysis, FISH or PCR-aneuploidy. Amniocentesis is offered between 16 and 21 weeks. Because this involves inserting a thin needle through the abdominal wall into the uterus, there is a risk that the procedure can cause complications, including a spontaneous miscarriage, vaginal bleeding or leaking amniotic fluid. This risk is about 1 in 140 (0.7%) with an experienced ultrasonographer. The woman should be informed of this before deciding whether she wants prenatal diagnosis.
2.	She can continue the pregnancy without prenatal diagnosis, but knowing and understanding the risks for having an infant with Down syndrome.

### 3-34 What choices does a woman have when a confirmed prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome has been made?

If a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome is confirmed, the woman, preferably with her partner, should urgently receive genetic counselling regarding the diagnosis and their choices. These include:

1.	Continuing with the pregnancy.
2.	In South Africa they may request legal termination of pregnancy.

If termination of pregnancy is discussed with the parents in the course of prenatal care, this discussion should be within the limits of the legal term of reference of the country. Health-care providers must not give directive or coercive advice, are obliged to respect the religious and moral beliefs of the parents, and should abide by and support their decisions.

The legal terms of reference in South Africa can be found in the Choice of Termination of Pregnancy Act 92 of 1996. Under the Act women may apply for a termination before they are 20 weeks pregnant if the infant will have a severe mental or physical abnormality.

> With genetic screening and prenatal diagnosis people are entitled to genetic counselling and always have the right of choice.

## Case study 1

A 37-year-old mother of two normal children asks whether she would be at increased risk of having an infant with Down syndrome if she planned another child. She wants to know how common Down syndrome is in South Africa and whether most infants with Down syndrome are born to older women.

### 1. Is this woman at an increased risk of Down syndrome?

Yes. Because she is older than 35 years. At 37 years, her calculated risk is 1:234 on the risk table. This is higher than a risk of 1:1250 for a woman who is 25 years old. Therefore, the risk is at least five times greater at 37 than at 25 years.

### 2. What is the birth prevalence of Down syndrome in South Africa?

The birth prevalence of Down syndrome in South Africa is about 2 per 1000 live births.

### 3. Why is the prevalence lower than the birth prevalence of Down syndrome in South Africa?

The prevalence (number of children with Down syndrome per 1000 children in the community) is lower than the birth prevalence because so many infants with Down syndrome die in the first few years of life. In rural areas of South Africa, the prevalence may be one third the birth prevalence, indicating that two thirds of these children die during infancy and early childhood.

### 4. Why is the birth prevalence of Down syndrome lower in industrialised than in developing countries?

In industrialised countries women are better informed and more aware about the risk of Down syndrome in pregnancy with advanced maternal age (AMA). Women, therefore, use family planning and usually have their infants before the age of 35 years. Genetic counselling, genetic screening, prenatal diagnosis and other services are also more available and used in industrialised countries.

### 5. Are most infants with Down syndrome born to older women?

Yes, in developing countries such as South Africa. However, in industrialised countries, such as the USA and Europe, most infants with Down syndrome are born to younger women as the number of infants born to women over 35 years is small.

### 6. Why is Down syndrome often not recognised at birth in South Africa?

Because both the general community and health-care workers are not informed and aware of the condition and the typical clinical features. This is improving through education. It is important that the diagnosis is made and the parents be told the diagnosis and counselled as early as possible after birth.

## Case study 2

A midwife notices that a newborn infant does not appear normal. The mother says the infant does not look like her other five children. The infant has a small, flat face with upward slanting eyes, a flat nasal bridge and keeps sticking her tongue out. She is also very floppy and feeds poorly.

### 1. Does this infant have the typical facial appearances of Down syndrome?

Yes. She may also have a flat occiput, small ears and a lot of loose skin over the back of her neck. Some infants with Down syndrome do not have all the typical features.

### 2. What should the midwife look for if she examines the infant’s hands and feet?

Both hands and feet are short and broad. The hands may have a single palmar crease, and often a short curved little finger with a single finger crease. There is often a wide gap (sandal gap) between the first (big) and second toe.

### 3. Are infants with Down syndrome often floppy with poor feeding?

Yes. They are all hypotonic (floppy) with a poor Moro reflex and head lag. As they grow older the hypotonia improves. Poor feeding in the first weeks of life is common in infants with Down syndrome. This is partly due to the relatively large tongue. Some are unable to breastfeed at first and may need to be fed expressed breast milk by cup.

### 4. What is the pattern of growth in infants with Down syndrome?

Most infants with Down syndrome are born at term but have a lower birth weight, length and head circumference than usual. They continue to grow slowly after birth. As children, adolescents and adults they are short and may become obese.

### 5. What is the life expectancy in children with Down syndrome in an industrialised country?

In industrialised countries many can be expected to survive to between 50 and 60 years. However, in a developing country many die in childhood from infections and congenital heart defects. Therefore, the life expectancy varies widely between different countries.

## Case study 3

A three-month-old infant is brought to a local clinic where the diagnosis of Down syndrome had been made at birth. The mother says that the child gets very short of breath and becomes cyanosed (blue) with feeds. She wants to know whether her child will be able to attend a normal school.

### 1. What is the probable complication in this child with Down syndrome?

It may have a congenital heart defect or pneumonia. Almost 45% of infants with Down syndrome have a congenital heart defect. Severe and recurrent infections, especially chest infections, are common. Congenital heart defects, such as a ventricular septal defect, often result in pneumonia.

### 2. What other congenital malformation may present in the first days of life?

Duodenal atresia. This is an obstruction in the duodenum which presents with repeated vomiting in the first few days of life. The vomitus is often bile stained. They need urgent referral to hospital for confirmation of the diagnosis and surgery.

### 3. Do children with Down syndrome have normal intelligence?

No. They all have developmental delay and some degree of intellectual disability. They often also have visual and hearing problems which may interfere with their speech development.

### 4. Can they attend a normal school?

If possible they should attend a normal school. However, they will need special help. Therefore, with an ‘inclusion’ policy, a child with special needs, such as children with Down syndrome, is put into normal school.

### 5. How can children with Down syndrome be helped to reach their full developmental and intellectual potential?

They should receive love and early stimulation at home. Neurodevelopmental therapy, which is available at most major centres, will help them reach their developmental milestones sooner and have a better intellectual outcome (IQ). Community-based rehabilitation programmes should be available for children with Down syndrome in smaller towns and rural areas. Every effort must be made to meet their emotional, health and educational needs.

## Case study 4

A primigravid woman with a 12-week pregnancy attends her first antenatal clinic. After receiving the routine antenatal care she has an ultrasound examination. She is asked to return the next day for further tests.

### 1. Is an ultrasound examination a reliable method of screening for Down syndrome?

Ultrasound examination in early pregnancy is a very useful method of screening for Down syndrome. Between 11 and 13 weeks of pregnancy, many fetuses with Down syndrome can be detected (about 70%). Other birth defects may also be diagnosed.

### 2. What other tests may be helpful to screen for Down syndrome?

A maternal serum test (triple test), done between 15 and 18 weeks, is very useful. Together with maternal age and an ultrasound examination, these screening tests will identify up to 85% of fetuses with an increased risk of Down syndrome.

### 3. What should be done if the screening tests indicate a high risk for Down syndrome?

After counselling, the woman should be offered an amniocentesis at 16 to 21 weeks gestation to obtain some fetal cells. FISH and PCR-aneuploidy tests can be used to identify trisomy. Chromosomal analysis will also confirm or exclude the diagnosis of Down syndrome.

### 4. What should be done if the tests confirm Down syndrome?

The woman, preferably with her partner, should be urgently referred for further genetic counselling. The diagnosis and implications of Down syndrome will be discussed. The woman will have to consider the choices of further management and decide on her option of termination or continuation of her pregnancy. The final decision rests with the couple, who must be assured that their choice will not influence their future routine care.

# Single gene disorders

Before you begin this unit, please take the corresponding test to assess your knowledge of the subject matter. You should redo the test after you’ve worked through the unit, to evaluate what you have learned.

## Objectives

When you have completed this unit you should be able to:

*	Define a single gene disorder.
*	Describe Waardenburg syndrome, oculocutaneous albinism, and haemophilia.
*	Explain how these conditions are inherited.
*	Recognise the clinical features of a person with any of these conditions.
*	List the clinical complications of these conditions.
*	Plan the care of a person with these conditions.
*	Explain how these conditions can be diagnosed prenatally.

## Introduction to single gene disorders

### 4-1 What is a single gene defect?

This is an abnormality (mutation) in a single gene which results in a genetic disorder (birth defect). Single gene defects cause many structural and functional (biochemical or metabolic) birth defects. The number of chromosomes is normal with a single gene defect.

A single gene defect may be inherited in a number of different patterns:

1.	Autosomal dominant, e.g. Waardenburg syndrome.
1.	Autosomal recessive, e.g. oculocutaneous albinism.
1.	X-linked recessive, e.g. haemophilia.

In addition, a single gene defect may be due to a new mutation (autosomal dominant or X-linked recessive). With a new mutation affected individuals will not have a family history of that condition.

> Single gene defects cause clinical conditions resulting from mutations in a single gene.

Waardenburg syndrome, oculocutaneous albinism and haemophilia are typical examples of disorders due to single gene defects with different patterns of inheritance. They illustrate many of the problems and principles of care and management for people with single gene defects, and their families.

## Waardenburg syndrome

### 4-2 What is Waardenburg syndrome?

Waardenburg syndrome is an inherited disorder that is made up of a recognisable collection of clinical features including deafness. It is the commonest cause of inherited deafness associated with a known syndrome in southern Africa.

### 4-3 How is Waardenburg syndrome inherited?

Waardenburg syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder:

1.	About two thirds of individuals with Waardenburg syndrome have inherited the abnormal dominant gene, and therefore the clinical condition, from an affected parent.
1.	The remaining third of people with Waardenburg syndrome have the condition as the result of a new gene mutation. Therefore their parents are normal and neither has the abnormal gene.

Note
:	The new gene mutation for Waardenburg syndrome is associated with advanced paternal age (having a father older than 50 years) at the time of birth.

> Waardenburg syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder.

### 4-4 How common is Waardenburg syndrome?

Waardenburg syndrome is rare. It occurs in about 1 in 30 000 people in all populations.

In southern Africa approximately 4% of people with profound deafness have Waardenburg syndrome. This is similar to studies from other parts of the world where the prevalence of Waardenburg syndrome amongst deaf people varies from 2 to 5%.

### 4-5 What are the main clinical features of people with Waardenburg syndrome?

The main clinical features of Waardenburg syndrome are:

1.	Very blue eyes (sapphire blue). The iris of both eyes can have this extraordinary blue colouring which is very noticeable in black Africans who usually have brown eyes. In some cases only one eye or part of the iris has this colouring and the other eye or part of the iris has the normal eye colour (heterochromia).
1.	Some people with Waardenburg syndrome have abnormal tear ducts. This can cause repeated eye infections.
1.	Eyebrows. The inner (medial) part of the eyebrow is very bushy and often the eyebrows meet in the middle (synophoris).
1.	Deafness. Sensory (nerve) deafness is the most serious feature of Waardenburg syndrome. It usually involves both ears and is severe. Deafness is found in 25 to 50% of people with Waardenburg syndrome.
1.	A white forelock. Between 30 and 40% of people with Waardenburg syndrome have a white or grey patch of hair in the middle and front of their heads. This may vary from a small area that is not very obvious to a large striking white forelock of hair.
1.	Early greying of hair and eyebrows. This begins in the twenties in some people with Waardenburg syndrome.
1.	Partial albinism. About 20% of people with Waardenburg syndrome have patches of skin with less or no pigmentation.

> Individuals with Waardenburg syndrome can be deaf and have a characteristic white forelock.

Note
:	There are considered to be two main forms of Waardenburg syndrome, types I and II, both of which have similar features but which can be told apart because type I has dystopia canthorum and type II does not. Dystopia canthorum is the name given to the facial feature in which the inner corners (canthi) of each eye are further apart than normal and the nasal bridge is broad. Careful examination of the lower eyelid will also show that the openings to the tear ducts (lacrimal puncta) are further away from the inner corners of the eye than usual. People with Waardenburg syndrome type II do not have these features. Deafness is found in 25% of people with type I and 50% of people with type II Waardenburg syndrome. In southern Africa, type I is the commonest (over 50%) form of Waardenburg syndrome.

### 4-6 Must a person have all these features to be diagnosed with Waardenburg syndrome?

No. Three or more of the main features must be present to consider the clinical diagnosis. In Waardenburg syndrome, as is found in many other syndromes, the number and severity of the clinical features present can vary greatly. This is called variation in expression of the syndrome (i.e. not all the features are expressed).

### 4-7 Is there a test to confirm the diagnosis of Waardenburg syndrome?

Yes. The gene for Waardenburg syndrome can be identified to confirm the diagnosis. However, the test is expensive and currently not undertaken in South Africa.

### 4-8 What are the major complications of Waardenburg syndrome?

1.	Deafness and the problems associated with this, including lack of speech and communication ability, schooling problems and social stigmatisation.
2.	Recurrent eye infections (conjunctivitis) in infants and children caused by the problems with the tear ducts.

### 4-9 Are people with Waardenburg syndrome intellectually disabled?

No. However, infants and children with deafness from any cause, including Waardenburg syndrome, are often considered to be developmentally delayed. This is because of the lack of speech and inability to communicate. If the problem is discovered early and appropriate speech therapy started, many of the developmental problems may be overcome and the person is shown to have normal intelligence.

### 4-10 What care is available for people with Waardenburg syndrome?

1.	Early diagnosis:

	In people with Waardenburg syndrome, as with all cases of infant and childhood deafness, it is very important to diagnose their deafness as early as possible to ensure they can start early with intervention programmes. This will ensure the best long-term outcome for the person’s communication ability. The early clinical confirmation of the diagnosis of Waardenburg syndrome is also important so that genetic counselling can be offered to the family.

2.	Managing the deafness:

	The early diagnosis of deafness, in infancy if possible, is important so speech and communication therapy can be started early ensuring the best long-term results. Assessment to decide if hearing aids may benefit the infant or child should also be done as early as possible. Assessment and initial speech therapy need to be done at a specialised centre. On-going day-to-day speech therapy in areas far from such centres may be made possible for infants and young children with the help of community-based rehabilitation workers. However, to achieve the best results, these children will need to regularly attend centres for specialised on-going assessment and therapy and eventually need to go to schools for the auditory disabled (deaf).

3.	Manage repeated eye infections:

	Conjunctivitis needs to be treated with repeated swabbing of the eye with clean water (boiled and then cooled), massaging the tear duct, and antibiotic drops or ointment if indicated. If the problem recurs often then surgical probing of the tear duct can be performed.

4.	Genetic counselling and psychosocial support.

### 4-11 What genetic counselling is needed by parents who have a child with Waardenburg syndrome?

Genetic counselling is a major part of the care of people with Waardenburg syndrome and their family, especially the parents. The parents need to be educated and informed about:

1.	The diagnosis.
2.	The cause of Waardenburg syndrome. That Waardenburg syndrome is a genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, in a third of patients it may occur for the first time in a family as a new mutation.
3.	What Waardenburg syndrome means for the affected person and what can be done to treat the various problems.
4.	The risks for parents with a child with Waardenburg syndrome having a child with Waardenburg syndrome in future pregnancies and their options for reducing this risk and preventing the birth of another affected child.

The parents, family and child with Waardenburg syndrome need to be offered on-going psychosocial support as with all individuals who have a congenital disability. There is currently no support group for Waardenburg syndrome in South Africa.

### 4-12 What is the risk for parents of a child with Waardenburg syndrome having affected children in future pregnancies?

To assess this risk, the parents have to be examined to see if one of them has signs of Waardenburg syndrome. Because of variation of expression of the syndrome it may not have been diagnosed in one of them, as their symptoms and signs may not be as severe or numerous as in their child. For example, an affected parent may not necessarily be deaf.

If a parent is diagnosed with Waardenburg syndrome, then all future children of that parent have a 1 in 2 (50%) risk of having Waardenburg syndrome. These children with Waardenburg syndrome, when they have grown up and have their own children, will also have a 1 in 2 (50%) risk of passing the syndrome to each of their offspring. This is typical of an autosomal recessive disorder.

If both parents of a child with Waardenburg syndrome are normal, then the cause of Waardenburg syndrome in the child is due to a new mutation. Future children of that couple will have only a very small risk of being affected with Waardenburg syndrome. But the affected child will have a 1 in 2 (50%) risk of having an affected child when he or she becomes a parent.

### 4-13 Can Waardenburg syndrome be prevented?

Yes. Because the genes for Waardenburg syndrome are known, it is possible to do prenatal diagnosis. However, as the test is not currently offered in South Africa, prenatal diagnosis of Waardenburg syndrome is not practical.

## Oculocutaneous albinism

### 4-14 What is albinism?

Albinism is an inherited condition. The clinical signs and symptoms of albinism are caused by a lack of melanin in the cells of the body. Melanin is the pigment that gives colour to the skin, hair and eyes.

Note
:	Albinism occurs in many animals such as the white lions of Timbavati.

### 4-15 Are there different types of albinism?

Yes, there are different forms of albinism:

1.	Albinism with a lack of pigment in the eye (oculo-) plus skin (cutaneous) and hair. This is called oculocutaneous albinism or OCA.
2.	Albinism which only affects the eyes and not the skin or hair. This is called ocular albinism.

> Oculocutaneous albinism is the result of a lack of pigment in the eyes, skin and hair.

Note
:	Oculocutaneous albinism is further classified into types I and II. In sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa, oculocutaneous albinism type II is the most common form of albinism found.

### 4-16 How is oculocutaneous albinism inherited?

OCA is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. Therefore, a person affected with OCA has received two copies of the abnormal gene (homozygous) that is responsible for melanin production (i.e. one abnormal gene from each parent). As a result, the cells of an affected individual are unable to produce normal amounts of pigment and, therefore, they are very pale.

Each parent of an affected individual has one normal and one abnormal copy of the pigment gene (i.e. is heterozygous). Because they have one normal gene that can produce melanin, they have normal pigmentation and do not show signs of OCA.

> Oculocutaneous albinism is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder.

### 4-17 How common is oculocutaneous albinism?

Oculocutaneous albinism is the commonest single gene disorder in South Africa. The population prevalence of OCA in the Black population is 1 in 4000. However, it is even higher in those communities that accept intermarriage (consanguinity) as part of their culture (e.g. the Venda, Tswana, Pedi and Southern Sotho peoples). The population prevalence of OCA in other ethnic groups in South Africa is not known.

Note
:	The population prevalence of OCA is similar throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa, varying between 1 in 4000 to 5000 people. The highest prevalence, 1 in 1000, is found in the isolated Batonka people who live in the Zambezi River valley. In contrast, in Europe, the prevalence of OCA varies between 1 in 10 000 and 20 000.

> Oculocutaneous albinism is the commonest single gene disorder in South Africa.

### 4-18 What are the main clinical features of oculocutaneous albinism?

People affected with OCA have normal physical and facial features, but have markedly decreased pigmentation of their skin, hair and eyes resulting in all these features being pale. Black people with OCA are, therefore, easily recognised. In White people, OCA is less obvious. The features of OCA are:

1.	*Skin*

	They have pale skin which is very sensitive to sunlight.

	Note
	:	They may have small spidery pigmented patches called ephilides scattered over their bodies, mainly on sun-exposed areas such as the arms and faces.

2.	*Hair*

	A black African with OCA usually has pale or corn-coloured hair. The hair colour in a few individuals may be brown or reddish (rufous).

3.	*Eyes*

	Black African people with OCA have brown eyes, but their eyes may be lighter brown than normal. They have numerous eye problems.

### 4-19 What eye problems are common in people with oculocutaneous albinism?

1.	Photophobia. Sensitivity to bright light and glare.
2.	They all have nystagmus. This is jerky movements of the eyes in a horizontal or vertical direction or both.
3.	Most have poor vision (96%). About two-thirds are short sighted (myopia) and a third long sighted (hyperopia).

> All people with oculocutaneous albinism have problems with their eyesight.

Note
:	Most people with OCA have astigmatism (92%) and poor depth judgement. They also have abnormal visual pathways as the gene for melanin production is responsible for the development of the optic nerve tracks from the eye to the visual centre at the back of the brain. Because of their abnormal visual pathways they do not have binocular vision like normal people.

### 4-20 What are the major complications of oculocutaneous albinism?

1.	*Skin*

	Normally, melanin prevents the sun’s ultraviolet rays being absorbed by the skin. If melanin is not present in adequate amounts, the ultraviolet rays in sunlight penetrate and damage the skin. Problems resulting from a lack of pigmentation in the skin include:

	*	Easy sun-burning and blistering.
	*	Rapid ageing of the skin which leaves it thin, dry and it is easily damaged. These areas of skin often become infected.
	*	Skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma). People with OCA are at high risk of developing cancer of the skin on sun-exposed areas, especially if the person does not take precautions to protect themselves from the sun. People living nearer the equator, where the sunlight is stronger, are at a higher risk.
	*	Early death from skin cancer is a serious risk for people with OCA.
2.	*Eyes*
	*	Lack of pigment in the eyes can result in sunlight-induced damage to the eyes. This will cause a further worsening in visual ability.
	*	As individuals with OCA have abnormal eyesight, they may experience school learning difficulties and job discrimination in later life.
3.	*Social stigmatisation*
	*	People with OCA in Africa look very different from the rest of the population.
	*	Throughout Africa, myths or legends regarding the birth, life and death of people with OCA are common. These myths can affect people’s attitudes to people with OCA, mostly negatively but in some populations positively. Therefore, in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa there is isolation and stigmatisation of people with OCA.

Research from South Africa indicates that people with OCA are now generally well accepted in the community, and they in turn appear to be reasonably well adjusted. Myths regarding people with OCA are, however, plentiful, and it has been reported that mothers of newborns with OCA experience problems bonding with their infants and may suffer from depression, similar to that described by mothers with other birth defects.

> Skin cancer is a common complication of oculocutaneous albinism.

### 4-21 What are some of the South African myths regarding people with oculocutaneous albinism?

1.	Birth myths:

	These are used to try and explain the unexpected birth of an infant with OCA. They include that the birth is a punishment for some supposed bad deed committed by the parent(s); that the mother conceived during menstruation; that the mother must have come into contact with a person with albinism during pregnancy; that the mother ate an excess of certain foods or had an infection during pregnancy.

2.	Life myths:

	These are about special qualities that people with OCA supposedly have. One of the common beliefs is that people with OCA may have special religious, spiritual or supernatural power. People with OCA are often considered either very intelligent or intellectually disabled.

3.	Death myths:

	The death of people with OCA is surrounded with superstition. It is widely believed that they do not die, but rather disappear or vanish.

### 4-22 Are children with oculocutaneous albinism intellectually disabled?

No. Children with OCA generally have a normal intelligence and are not intellectually disabled. Due to their visual disability, infants and young children may present with evidence of developmental delay. Older children may have schooling problems due to their poor vision or psychosocial problems. However, if these problems are recognised early and correctly treated with eye and visual care, early intervention programmes and counselling, they can be overcome.

### 4-23 What is the life expectancy of children with oculocutaneous albinism?

The life expectancy of people with OCA should be similar to that of normal people. However, due to the high risk of developing skin cancer, many unfortunately die in early adult life if not correctly treated and counselled. In Tanzania and Nigeria, countries in the tropics and close to the equator, only 10% of people with OCA live longer than 30 years. No figures on life expectancy are currently available for South Africa. However, it is considered to be better than the figure for Tanzania and Nigeria as South Africa is mostly outside of the tropics.

> Many people with oculocutaneous albinism die of skin cancer.

### 4-24 What is the correct care for people with oculocutaneous albinism?

1.	Early clinical diagnosis:

	The first step in caring for people with OCA is to make an early, correct diagnosis. OCA is a clinical diagnosis and is usually made at the birth of the infant, especially in the black African infants in whom the diagnosis is very obvious. However, the clinical signs can be more difficult to recognise in White or Asian infants.

2.	Good skin and eye care:

	Good skin and eye care is essential to prevent skin cancer and progressive loss of eyesight.

3.	Neurodevelopmental therapy, special education and rehabilitation:

	This should be provided in the community, if possible, to enable these children to learn and develop normally.

4.	Genetic counselling and psychosocial support.

### 4-25 What skin care is needed for children with oculocutaneous albinism?

It is essential for people with OCA to reduce their exposure to sunlight to the greatest extent possible. As it is not possible for a person with OCA to remain out of the sun continually, when they do go outdoors they should wear clothes to cover as much skin as possible, i.e. long trousers or skirts, long-sleeved tops or shirts, and hats with wide brims.

Sun-exposed skin, especially hands, arms and face, should be covered with cream containing sunscreen (sun barrier creams). Cream with sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or greater must be used. Moisturising cream should be used on dry, cracking or chaffed skin, and skin infection should be treated vigorously with antiseptics and antibiotics if clinically indicated. Unfortunately many clinics do not have sun barrier creams. They are expensive to buy.

Adolescents and adults with OCA should be aware of the dangers of skin cancer. They should be taught how to recognise areas of skin cancer so that they know what to look for to be able to suspect and possibly diagnose cancer as early as possible (e.g. sores that do not heal). In addition they should have yearly examinations to exclude the development of skin cancer.

> Good skin protection against sunlight is essential to prevent skin cancer.

### 4-26 What eye care is needed for children with oculocutaneous albinism?

People with OCA need to protect their eyes from the harmful effects of sun and bright light by avoiding it where possible and wearing protective eyewear (appropriate dark glasses with an ultraviolet screen) and broad-brimmed hats. In this way, further damage to their visual disability can be minimised.

All people with OCA should have regular ophthalmic or optometric assessments from infancy. This is necessary to ensure they obtain the correct glasses and treatment for their individual problems. This gives them the best chance of reasonable vision and ensures that their sight is not damaged by the lack of eye care.

> Good eye care, protection from the sun, and the correct glasses are essential to protect eye sight.

### 4-27 What neurodevelopmental therapy, community-based rehabilitation and special education are needed for children with oculocutaneous albinism?

1.	In infants and children with severe visual disability it may be necessary for them to receive neurodevelopmental therapy, e.g. occupational therapy at their local hospital.
1.	If specialised therapy is not available in their area they will have to rely on local community-based rehabilitation services.
1.	When children with OCA reach school-going age, decisions will need to be made regarding school placement. Where possible, children with OCA should be encouraged to attend normal schools. Efforts to assist them in a normal school may be necessary, e.g. placement in the front row of the class. If, however, their visual disability is too severe, then scholars may need to be placed in a school for the visually disabled.

### 4-28 What genetic counselling is needed for families with oculocutaneous albinism?

Genetic counselling is a major part of the care of people with OCA and their family, especially their parents. The parents need to be educated and informed about:

1.	The diagnosis, which is a clinical one and is usually obvious.
1.	The cause of OCA. To explain that OCA is a genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This information can be used to try and dismiss the myths about why an infant with OCA is born to a couple.
1.	What OCA means for the affected person, what can be done to prevent and manage the various problems. It is essential to stress that every effort must be made to avoid direct sunlight on the skin and in the eyes by not spending a lot of time in the sun, wearing the proper clothes and protective eyewear and using sunscreen cream.
1.	The risks for normal parents with an OCA infant having another child with OCA in future pregnancies. Their options for reducing the risk of having another infant with OCA should be discussed.

The parents, family and person with OCA need to be offered on-going psychosocial support.

### 4-29 What is the risk for normal parents of a child with oculocutaneous albinism having other affected children in future pregnancies?

OCA is an autosomal recessive condition. As carriers of a single abnormal OCA gene, parents of a child with OCA have a 1 in 4 risk (25%) of having a further affected child in every future pregnancy. With another partner, the chance of either parent having an affected child is very small.

### 4-30 How can oculocutaneous albinism be prevented?

The gene for OCA has been identified and, therefore, it is possible to offer prenatal diagnosis for OCA to parents who both carry the abnormal gene. This can only be done after the parents receive genetic counselling. Genetic counselling is ideally undertaken before conception, or in the first 10 weeks of the pregnancy. The prenatal gene test is done on fetal cells obtained by amniocentesis at 16 weeks. Once the result of the prenatal test is available, further genetic counselling will be necessary to discuss these results.

### 4-31 Why do people with oculocutaneous albinism, and their family, need psychosocial support?

People with OCA, as with all individuals who have a congenital disability, suffer lifelong problems which require lifelong care. The burden of the disorder is experienced not only by the affected person, but also the family, especially parents, brothers and sisters. Mothers of newborns with OCA need psychosocial support to help them accept and bond with their infant, and overcome possible depression. In addition, the problem is genetic and thus there is the possibility for the parents, the affected person and other family members to also have children affected with OCA. Support, help and reassurance in these circumstances may be a lifelong need.

### 4-32 Who can offer psychosocial support?

Professional psychosocial support can be obtained from:

1.	Doctors, nurses (especially nurses with postgraduate genetic training), genetic counsellors and neurodevelopmental therapists.
1.	Social workers.
1.	Patient/parent support groups. These groups play a vital role in offering information and support to people affected with congenital disability.

Note
:	There is a strong support group for people with OCA in South Africa, the Albinism Society of South Africa (ASSA), P O Box 9881, Johannesburg, 2000. (Tel: 011- 838-629)

## Haemophilia

### 4-33 What is haemophilia?

Haemophilia is an inherited, lifelong bleeding disorder which affects mainly males.

There are two types of haemophilia, haemophilia A and haemophilia B. Haemophilia A (classical haemophilia) is the common form of haemophilia. Both types present clinically as a bleeding problem.

### 4-34 Why do patients with haemophilia bleed excessively?

Haemophilia A is caused by a lack of normal functioning clotting factor VIII (eight) while haemophilia B is caused by a lack of normally functioning clotting factor IX (nine).

Note
:	It is the low level of function, rather than a low concentration of the clotting factor in the blood, which results in an increased tendency to bleed. The single gene defect results in the formation of a defective clotting factor, which does not function normally.

> Haemophilia is a bleeding disorder due to the lack of a normal clotting factor.

### 4-35 How is haemophilia inherited?

Both types of haemophilia are inherited as **X-linked recessive** disorders. There are different single gene defects on the X chromosome for haemophilia A and haemophilia B on the X chromosome.

A woman with a haemophilia gene (i.e. an abnormal gene) on only one X chromosome is a carrier (i.e. she is a heterozygote). Because she has a normal gene on her other X chromosome, she will still be able to produce enough clotting factor. If she passes the X chromosome containing the abnormal gene on to her daughter, then her daughter will also be a carrier.

If a son inherits the X chromosome with the haemophilia gene from his mother, he will have haemophilia as his short Y chromosome does not have the gene to produce the clotting factor.

> Haemophilia is inherited as an X-linked recessive condition. Women carry the abnormal gene and their sons are at 50% risk of inheriting haemophilia.

### 4-36 Can females have haemophilia?

Yes. About 10% of female carriers have signs of mild haemophilia. All patients with moderate or severe haemophilia are males.

Note
:	If a daughter inherits a haemophilia gene from her carrier mother and another from her haemophiliac father, both her X chromosomes will contain the abnormal gene and she will have haemophilia. This is very rare.

### 4-37 How common is haemophilia?

1.	Haemophilia A occurs in approximately 1 in 5000 males throughout the world.
1.	Haemophilia B occurs in approximately 1 in 40 000 males throughout the world.

In South Africa, haemophilia A has been found in 1 in 5000 white males but only 1 in 20 000 black males. Due to poor socioeconomic conditions and inadequate access to health care in many black communities, some black people with haemophilia A may not be diagnosed and registered. Others may die very young with severe bleeding without the diagnosis being made. Therefore the population prevalence is less than expected.

### 4-38 What are the main clinical features of people with haemophilia?

People with haemophilia present with **excessive bleeding**. The bleeding may be in the skin and mucous membranes (bruising), muscle, joints, internal organs or brain. Infants usually bleed into soft tissues while older boys usually bleed into joints.

The severity and frequency of bleeds depends on the concentration of clotting factors VIII and IX in the patient’s blood:

1.	People with mild haemophilia only have 5 to 35% of the normal factor VIII or IX level. They usually only bleed following severe trauma and at surgery. Because bleeding is not a major problem they may only be diagnosed later in life.
1.	People with moderate haemophilia have between 1 and 5% of the normal factor VIII or IX level and they bruise easily. They usually bleed excessively following trauma, surgery or dental care but rarely have spontaneous bleeds. They usually do not have serious problems with bleeding into joints. Diagnosis before the age of five years is possible.
1.	People with severe haemophilia have less than 1% of the normal factor VIII or IX level and may bleed spontaneously or with minimal trauma. They can bleed in any part of the body but some parts such as the large joints (knees, ankle and elbow) are more at risk of injury and bleeding. Diagnosis should occur in the first year of life.

Bleeding is unusual in newborns but infants with haemophilia can bleed from circumcision sites. Infants with severe haemophilia will bleed into muscles from injection or needle-stick sites or spontaneously into cephalhaematomas or within the skull (intracranial bleed).

### 4-39 Are there tests to confirm the diagnosis of haemophilia?

Yes. If haemophilia is suspected, the following tests can be done to confirm the diagnosis:

1.	Partial thromboplastin time (PTT). This is prolonged in people with moderate and severe haemophilia. However, it can be normal in people with mild haemophilia.
1.	Clotting factor VIII levels are low in people with haemophilia A while clotting factor IX levels are low is people with haemophilia B.
1.	Gene (DNA-based) tests. The genes for haemophilia A and B are known and can be analysed in South Africa. The test is expensive and not simple, and therefore is only used after genetic counselling in special circumstances, including prenatal diagnosis, testing for carriers and confirming a diagnosis.

### 4-40 What are the major complications of haemophilia?

These relate to the severity and site of bleeding. A person with haemophilia may have bleeding problems in any part of the body. Major bleeds can cause death or disability and they require immediate treatment with the correct clotting factor. Minor bleeds also require treatment and, depending on their position, may cause complications.

Sites into which bleeding occurs include:

1.	*Joints*

	Joint bleeds (haemarthrosis) into the knees, elbows and ankles are common and are the most disabling complication of severe haemophilia. Joint bleeds present with pain, swelling, stiffness and refusal to move that limb. Treatment must be started with the correct clotting factor every 12 to 24 hours, and the joint must be splinted. Ice packs can be used to lessen the swelling. Failure to effectively treat these bleeds will eventually result in affected joints becoming fixed and not able to move due to the damage that the blood causes in the joint. Arthritis can develop. Physical disability resulting from joint damage is a major problem for people with haemophilia in developing countries.

2.	*Muscle and soft tissues*
	*	Bleeding into muscles and soft tissues (such as the neck and throat) may be life threatening and need immediate treatment with clotting factors. Bleeding into muscle is very painful and can be dangerous. If not managed properly it can result in pressure on nerves, leading to nerve damage with paralysis and wasting of limbs.
	*	Cuts of the mouth and tongue, tooth extractions and nose bleeds may ooze for long periods and require treatment.
3.	*Internal bleeding*

	Bleeding into the organs of the abdomen and chest is less common but may be spontaneous and serious. Abdominal pain in a boy with haemophilia always suggests a bleed.

Intracranial bleeding (within the skull) can be spontaneous or result from minor trauma, often not recognised in a child. Intracranial bleeding presents as headache, vomiting, and lethargy or irritability. Urgent clotting factor replacement is needed with internal bleeding.

### 4-41 When should the clinical diagnosis of haemophilia be suspected?

The diagnosis of haemophilia should be suspected if a male presents with:

1.	Large cephalhaematoma or unexplained intracranial bleeding in newborns.
1.	Excess bleeding from circumcision.
1.	Prolonged or repeated nose bleeding, and especially if it is from both nostrils.
1.	Prolonged oozing or renewed bleeding after mouth injury or tooth extraction.
1.	Easy and excessive bruising, especially if a firm subcutaneous lump is felt with the bruise.
1.	Deep muscle haematomas (collections of blood).
1.	Haemarthrosis (bleeding into joints).
1.	Prolonged oozing or renewed bleeding after surgery or trauma.

A female carrier with mild haemophilia may be suspected if she has a close male relative (brother, son or maternal uncle) with haemophilia and presents with heavy periods (menorrhagia), easy bruising or bleeding after trauma, surgery or childbirth.

It is suspected that the diagnosis of haemophilia is being missed in many cases in South Africa. Correct diagnosis of haemophilia is needed to be able to give the correct treatment and genetic counselling. A PTT test can be used to confirm that the bleeding is due to a lack of one of the clotting factors.

Note
:	Blood for a PTT test must be drawn in a Vacutainer tube with a blue top and must be kept cool and reach the laboratory within a few hours.

### 4-42 What is the treatment of bleeding due to haemophilia?

Bleeding is rapidly controlled by giving intravenous factor VIII concentrate in haemophilia A and factor IX concentrate in haemophilia B. This is to stop further bleeding and will assist in reducing pain and lowers the risk of developing serious complications, especially chronic joint disease. For major bleeds, clotting factors should be given in hospital. However, patients over two years of age can often be treated at home.

Where possible, children with severe haemophilia are now being given prophylactic home therapy with clotting factor three times a week to prevent bleeding episodes from occurring.

Once factor VIII or IX concentrate has been given, further treatment of the problems may be needed, such as splinting during recovery, and physiotherapy to help preserve movement in the recovery phase. All operations need to take place under the cover of clotting factor replacement to ensure that there will be no excessive bleeding.

**Never give aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs** (e.g. Voltaren and Indocid) to someone with haemophilia as these drugs increase the risk of bleeding. Haemophilia is a serious condition and must be managed in partnership with a provincial haemophilia treatment centre. Paracetamol (Panado) can safely be used for pain relief.

> As soon as bleeding is suspected in someone with haemophilia, immediate treatment with the correct clotting factor concentrate must be started.

Note
:	Vasopressin given nasally or intravenously increases the level of factor VIII and is useful in treating mild haemophiliacs. Tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron) can be added to the clotting factor infusion to help maintain clots in bleeding from the mouth, nose or tooth sockets.

### 4-43 What genetic counselling is needed by people with haemophilia and their families?

Genetic counselling is an important part of the care of people with haemophilia, and their families. All need to be educated and informed on:

1.	**The diagnosis**: The clinical features and the blood tests to confirm the diagnosis.
1.	**The pattern of inheritance**: About 80% of males with haemophilia have a mother who is a carrier of the single gene defect on one of her X chromosomes. About 10% of these carrier mothers have mild symptoms and signs of haemophilia. The 20% of males with haemophilia, who do not have carrier mothers (no family history of bleeding), have a new mutation of their haemophilia gene.
1.	**What care is needed**: What haemophilia means for the affected person and what can be done to treat the various problems.
1.	**Risks for future children** also having haemophilia: Parents of a child with haemophilia need to understand the risk of having another child with haemophilia. They must also be told about their options and possibilities for reducing this risk and preventing the birth of another affected child. The parents also need to know of the risk that their daughters have for inheriting the abnormal gene from their mother, and therefore being a carrier. They need to understand what this will mean for the daughters.

### 4-44 Where can patients with haemophilia and their parents get help?

The parents, family and child with haemophilia need to be offered on-going psychosocial support as they have problems which require lifelong care. The burden of the disorder and the care is experienced not only by the affected person, but also the family, especially parents, brothers and sisters. Support, help and reassurance in these circumstances may be obtained from:

1.	Doctors, nursing staff (especially haemophilia and nursing staff trained in genetics), genetic counsellors, physiotherapists and social workers.
1.	A Patient/Parent support group. These groups play a vital role in offering information and support to people affected with congenital disability. There is currently a very strong haemophilia support group in South Africa.

	Haemophilia Treatment Centre: 031 360 3680

### 4-45 What is the risk for parents, with a son with haemophilia, having affected sons in future pregnancies?

If the mother is a carrier of the abnormal gene then in each of her future male pregnancies she will have a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of having a son affected with haemophilia.

If the mother is NOT a carrier of an abnormal haemophilia gene then her risk for having another son with haemophilia is very small.

Note
:	With no family history of haemophilia, it has recently been shown that the mother may be a carrier, having inherited a new mutation from her elderly father. He would not have haemophilia but his sperm had a new mutation in a haemophilia gene on the X chromosome.

### 4-46 What is the risk for parents, with a son with haemophilia, having haemophilia carrier daughters?

The risk is 1 in 2 (50%). This is the same as the risk of having an affected son. The carrier mother has a 50/50 chance of giving her X chromosome with the abnormal gene to each of her children. This doesn’t mean that half her children will get it – they may all or none end up with it. The carrier daughters, like their mothers, have the same risks (50%) of passing the abnormal haemophilia gene on to their children.

### 4-47 How can you find out whether the mother of a child with haemophilia is a carrier?

If a couple has a son with haemophilia, then it is important to find out if his mother is a carrier of an abnormal haemophilia gene. There are two ways of finding this out:

1.	If the mother of the affected son has one other affected male member in her close family, such as a brother or uncle, then she is almost certainly a carrier of the abnormal gene for haemophilia.
1.	If the mother does not have such an affected close relative then she or her son with haemophilia may have a new mutation for the abnormal gene. The best way then to find out if the mother is a carrier of the abnormal gene is for her and her son to have a gene (DNA) test.

### 4-48 Can a father with haemophilia have affected children?

Men have one X and one Y chromosome. If a man has haemophilia he will have an abnormal haemophilia gene on his X chromosome but not on his Y chromosome (i.e. an X-linked recessive disorder). When he has children he gives his Y chromosome, with the no haemophilia gene, to his sons who will get their X chromosome from their mother. Therefore, if the mother is not a carrier of an abnormal haemophilia gene, their sons will not have haemophilia.

He will give his X chromosome, with the abnormal haemophilia gene, to his daughters who will all, therefore, be carriers of the abnormal haemophilia gene.

### 4-49 Can haemophilia be prevented?

Yes. Because the abnormal gene for haemophilia can be tested for, a woman who is a carrier of this abnormal gene can be offered prenatal diagnosis. This is done after she and her partner have had genetic counselling.

It is best to provide genetic counselling and to determine whether the woman is a carrier before she falls pregnant. Prenatal diagnosis is then done early in pregnancy. This is carried out by obtaining fetal cells by amniocentesis, and testing these cells to see if they have an abnormal haemophilia gene (A or B).

Note
:	The cells of the placenta can be obtained by chorionic villous biopsy, even earlier in pregnancy. The fetus and placenta have the same genes.

### 4-50 What special circumstances must be considered in haemophilia?

1.	If a woman is suspected of being a carrier of a haemophilia gene, the diagnosis must be confirmed or excluded before she becomes pregnant or as early in the pregnancy as possible. This allows for genetic counselling and the option of prenatal diagnosis to be offered. Ten percent of carriers may bleed heavily during a normal delivery or caesarean section. There is also a small risk (1–2%) of a male fetus, affected with severe haemophilia, having an intracranial bleed with a vaginal delivery. Women who are known carriers, or at risk of being carriers, of an abnormal haemophilia gene should be referred to a haemophilia treatment centre before and during pregnancy.
1.	In infants suspected of having haemophilia, circumcision should not be done and they should not be given intramuscular injections. Immunisations can be given subcutaneously. They must be referred for diagnostic tests.
1.	People with haemophilia should avoid medications that may cause bleeding. The most common and important of these is aspirin and the other non-steroidal (anti-inflammatory) analgesics (pain killers). Paracetamol (Panado) can be safely used for pain relief.

## Case study 1

A woman with Waardenburg syndrome delivers her first-born infant who also has a white forelock. She asks whether all her infants will have the same problem.

### 1. What are the main features of Waardenburg syndrome?

Very blue eyes, bushy eyebrows, deafness (25 to 50%) and a white forelock (30 to 40%). Premature greying of the hair and partial albinism is common.

### 2. How is Waardenburg inherited?

It is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder. This woman’s child has inherited her dominant gene for Waardenburg syndrome. Each of her future children will have a 50% chance of inheriting the condition.

### 3. Is there always a family history of the condition if a child presents with the features of Waardenburg syndrome?

No. As with many autosomal dominant disorders, the condition may appear as a new mutation and will not be inherited from a parent. About a third of patients with Waardenburg syndrome do not have a family history of the condition.

### 4. What is the main complication of Waardenburg syndrome?

Severe sensory deafness affecting both ears. As a result they often have speech difficulties which affect their schooling and socialisation. They are not intellectually disabled.

### 5. How common is Waardenburg syndrome in South Africa?

It is not common (about one in 30 000 people). However, about 4% of people with severe deafness have the condition.

## Case study 2

The first-born infant of black parents has very pale skin and hair with light-brown eyes. They notice that the child has abnormal eye movements and appears to have poor vision. The nurse at the local clinic tells them that they should use skin cream on the infant to prevent sunburn. The clinic does not have sun protection cream and the parents cannot afford to buy the cream.

### 1. What is the likely diagnosis in this infant?

The infant probably has oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) as there is lack of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes. This is the common form of albinism in southern Africa.

### 2. Are eye problems common in this condition?

Yes. All people with OCA have eye problems and most have poor vision. This infant has the typical jerky eye movements known as nystagmus.

### 3. Why is it important to use sun protection cream in these children?

Because they lack adequate pigment (melanin) to protect the skin from the ultraviolet rays of the sun, they suffer severe skin damage. Sunburn and blistering are common, resulting in rapid aging of the skin.

### 4. What skin complications should be looked for and treated?

Infections and cancer.

### 5. What is the life expectancy in people with oculocutaneous albinism?

Many die young as a result of skin cancer. This emphasises the importance of sun protection. The life expectancy of people with OCA in South Africa is not known.

## Case study 3

A woman, whose husband has oculocutaneous albinism, visits her general practitioner as they plan to start their family. She wants to know the risk of their children also being affected. She mentions that he gets upset as many people think he is intellectually disabled and some children are afraid of him

### 1. What is the pattern of inheritance in oculocutaneous albinism?

It is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. Therefore, the father must have two abnormal genes for melanin production (homozygous). Each of his children will have a 50% chance of inheriting one of his genes containing the single gene defect for OCA. If the mother does not have this gene, then these children will appear normal but will be carriers (heteroygotes). It is possible to test the mother to see whether she is a carrier. If she is, then the couple should be sent for genetic counselling.

### 2. How common is oculocutaneous albinism in South Africa?

The prevalence in the black population is 1 in 3900, making it the commonest single gene disorder in the country. The prevalence in other ethnic groups is unknown.

### 3. Are people with oculocutaneous albinism intellectually disabled?

No. They have normal intelligence. However, their many eye problems results in poor vision and this may interfere with their schooling.

### 4. Why may neighbouring children be afraid of someone with oculocutaneous albinism?

Because people with oculocutaneous albinism look different. Children should not be afraid of people with oculocutaneous albinism as they are normal people except for their colouring. There are also many myths about people with oculocutaneous albinism. In some communities these people are believed to have special powers.

### 5. Can oculocutaneous albinism be prevented?

The gene for OCA is known and, therefore, prenatal diagnosis is possible. Couples at risk of having a child with OCA should receive genetic counselling, preferably before they start a family.

## Case study 4

A newborn infant bleeds very heavily after circumcision. The mother reports that her uncle died of haemorrhage as a teenager after an operation, and that her brother is severely disabled due to repeated bleeds into his joints. She and her husband are well and have never had a bleeding problem.

### 1. How does haemophilia present clinically?

With excessive bleeding. Heavy bleeding after a circumcision is a typical way that haemophilia may present. Patients may bleed spontaneously or after trauma or surgery.

### 2. Is repeated bleeding into joints a common way that haemophilia presents?

Yes. Patients with severe haemophilia, who have less than 1% of the normal clotting factor activity, often bleed into big joints such as the knee, elbow or ankle. Repeated bleeds damage the joint resulting in pain and stiffness.

### 3. Why do people with haemophilia bleed excessively?

An inadequate amount of clotting factor VIII (in haemophilia A) or factor IX (in haemophilia B).

### 4. How is haemophilia inherited?

Both haemophilia A and B are inherited as X-linked recessive disorders. The females in the family carry the recessive gene on one of their X chromosome. Fifty percent of their male children will inherited the X chromosome with the abnormal gene, and as a result will have haemophilia. Both parents are usually clinically well without a bleeding problem although 10% of carrier mothers may have a mild problem.

### 5. How is the diagnosis of haemophilia usually confirmed?

The PTT (partial thromboplastin test) is abnormal and the concentration of either factor VIII (haemophilia A) or factor IX (haemophilia B) is low. The lower the concentration the more severe is the haemophilia. Haemophilia A is more common than haemophilia B.

### 6. How should a patient with a big bleed due to haemophilia be treated?

The missing clotting factor should urgently be replaced by intravenous transfusion of factor VIII for haemophila A or factor IX for haemophilia B. This is best done by immediate consultation with a haemophilia treatment centre.

Introduction to fetal alcohol syndrome

### 5-1 What is fetal alcohol syndrome?

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a recognisable clinical disorder which presents with clinical features that include:

Abnormalities in appearance.

Delayed growth and development.

Congenital malformations.

Fetal alcohol syndrome can often be recognised at birth although it is more easily recognisable in childhood. It is a typical example of a birth defect caused by a teratogen.

Fetal alcohol syndrome can often be recognised at birth.

Note
:	Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders include alcohol-related birth defects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders and fetal alcohol syndrome, as well as partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

### 5-2 What is the cause of fetal alcohol syndrome?

Drinking of alcohol by the mother during a pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome cannot occur if a woman does not drink any alcohol during her pregnancy or if she only drinks alcohol before or after the pregnancy.

Note
:	Fetal alcohol syndrome is caused by exposure of the embryo and fetus to ethyl alcohol.

Fetal alcohol syndrome is caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy.

### 5-3 Can fetal alcohol syndrome be inherited?

No. Fetal alcohol syndrome is not a genetically inherited condition. It is caused by alcohol, i.e. a teratogen (something which damages the fetus). However, there can be a number of individuals with fetal alcohol syndrome in a family (e.g. mother and child, or siblings) due to the excessive use of alcohol in that family.

### 5-4 Is fetal alcohol syndrome common?

While it is estimated that 1 in a 1000 infants have fetal alcohol syndrome in most industrialised countries (e.g. USA, UK, France, Sweden) there is concern that the rate of alcohol abuse is increasing and some children with fetal alcohol syndrome are not being recognised.

In South Africa fetal alcohol syndrome is common. In communities in the Western and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa the population prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in children attending their first year of school is more than 50 per 1000 children, i.e. 30 times commoner than Down syndrome. This is one of the highest reported rates for fetal alcohol syndrome in a community in the world. In Soweto the incidence is 20/1000 children.

An estimated 1.4% of all South African infants are born with fetal alcohol syndrome.

Note
:	Other developing countries where women abuse alcohol may also have a similarly high population prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome. However, the research needed to recognise  the problem has not yet been done.

### 5-5 Which communities have a high rate of fetal alcohol syndrome?

Fetal alcohol syndrome is most frequent in communities where poverty, low maternal education, unemployment and heavy or binge drinking are common.

The cause of fetal alcohol syndrome

### 5-6 How can alcohol taken during pregnancy damage the fetus?

Alcohol is a poisonous substance (teratogen), which, if drunk by the mother during pregnancy crosses the placenta and can interfere with the normal growth and development of the embryo and fetus.

Both the amount (dosage) and the time (stage of pregnancy) that alcohol is drunk are important. Alcohol is most damaging to the embryo in the period of organ development between 17–56 days after conception, but also harms the developing fetus from 56 days to delivery. The timing and amount of alcohol drunk will determine which organs are damaged and the degree of damage.

A past history of heavy alcohol drinking in a woman who does not drink during her pregnancy cannot cause fetal alcohol syndrome.

### 5-7 Does drinking alcohol during pregnancy always damage the fetus?

No. Not all women who drink during pregnancy have a child with fetal alcohol syndrome but the risk in South African women who drink heavily during pregnancy is greater than 50 percent.

### 5-8 How much alcohol is needed to damage the fetus?

Any amount of alcohol that a woman drinks during pregnancy may be harmful to her fetus. The more alcohol she drinks, the greater is the chance that she will have an infant with fetal alcohol syndrome.

Even small amounts of alcohol are not safe during pregnancy.

One or two drinks a day is regarded as light drinking, three to five drinks a day is moderate drinking while more than five drinks a day is heavy drinking. Moderate or heavy drinking may damage the fetus. However, any amount of alcohol carries a risk of damaging the fetus. It is not known what mild effects may be caused by light drinking as these are difficult to detect (e.g. a reduction in IQ or minor behaviour problems). A woman does not need be an alcoholic for her drinking to damage her fetus.

### 5-9 What is binge drinking?

This is defined as drinking more than five alcoholic drinks at a single occasion. In many South African communities, this is the usual way alcohol is taken and occurs mostly over weekends. The risk of fetal alcohol syndrome is particularly high with binge drinking during pregnancy.

Chronic drinking refers to the pattern of drinking throughout the week.

### 5-10 Is it best not to drink alcohol at all during pregnancy?

Yes. It is best for women not to drink any alcohol during pregnancy.

No amount of alcohol is considered safe during pregnancy.

### 5-11 How much alcohol is in one drink?

One drink is defined as 15 ml of absolute alcohol which is equivalent to a glass of wine (150 ml) or a can of beer (300 ml) or a tot of spirits (25 ml). A quart of beer (the largest container commercially sold and measuring 750 ml) is equivalent to 2.5 drinks and a standard bottle of wine (750 ml) is the same as five drinks. An estimate of what a person is drinking must be calculated from the history, taking care to understand what size of container the woman is using.

Note
:	Beer contains 5% alcohol, wine about 10% and spirits approximately 30–40%.

### 5-12 Are all alcoholic drinks dangerous to the fetus?

Yes. The risk of alcohol damaging the fetus depends on the amount of absolute alcohol taken and NOT the type of drink (e.g. whisky, beer, homebrew and wine). There are no alcoholic drinks which are safe during pregnancy.

All forms of alcohol are dangerous during pregnancy.

### 5-13 When is it most dangerous to drink alcohol during pregnancy?

Drinking alcohol is most dangerous between three and eight weeks of gestation (i.e. four to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period), as this may result in damage to the developing organs of the embryo (malformations). The organs most at risk during this time are the brain, heart, kidneys, eye, ear, palate and skeleton. Drinking alcohol during the first trimester may cause congenital malformations of any of these organs.

Therefore, women should stop drinking when they plan to fall pregnant, i.e. before conception.

Drinking alcohol is most dangerous during the first trimester of pregnancy.

Note
:	Drinking alcohol between three and eight weeks after conception may cause malformations in the developing embryo. At this stage some women do not know or are unsure they are pregnant.

### 5-14 Are there other periods during pregnancy when alcohol is dangerous to the fetus?

Yes, alcohol is dangerous throughout pregnancy. Even after 10 weeks of gestation, alcohol can still harm the fetus even though it may not cause congenital malformations. Fetal brain and physical growth can be affected if alcohol is drunk at any time during pregnancy. If the mother only starts to drink after the first three months of pregnancy, the growth of the fetal brain and body can be slowed causing brain damage and intra-uterine growth restriction.

Therefore, there is *no* time during pregnancy when it is safe for the mother to drink alcohol.

Women should stop drinking alcohol before they conceive, and not drink alcohol at any time during pregnancy, to ensure that their unborn infants are not damaged by alcohol.

### 5-15 What other factors may alter the risk of alcohol damaging the fetus?

Drinking alcohol affects individuals differently. Some individuals become drunk on small amounts of alcohol while others are unaffected by large volumes. The critical factor that determines the effect of alcohol in a person is the level of alcohol in their blood, the so-called blood alcohol concentration (BAC). An individual is more affected by a high blood alcohol concentration than by a low blood alcohol concentration.

A high maternal blood alcohol concentration also results in a high blood alcohol concentration in the fetus, as alcohol crosses the placenta easily. The higher the fetal blood alcohol concentration, the greater is the risk of damage to the fetus.

The more alcohol a mother drinks, the greater is the risk of damage to her fetus.

Women who can drink a lot of alcohol before becoming drunk are at a particularly high risk of having an infant with fetal alcohol syndrome as their fetusses are exposed to very high blood alcohol concentrations.

### 5-16 What factors affect the blood alcohol concentration?

Many factors affect the mother’s blood alcohol concentration and, therefore, the blood alcohol concentration of the fetus:

The amount of alcohol drunk (the volume and alcohol content of the drink).

Time taken to drink the alcohol.

Maternal weight.

Food intake at the time of drinking.

Smoking and other drug abuse at the same time as drinking alcohol.

Genetic factors.

Maternal malnutrition.

### 5-17 How does the amount of alcohol and the time taken to drink the alcohol affect the blood alcohol concentration?

There is a direct relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed, the time over which it was taken and the blood alcohol concentration. The greater the amount of alcohol drunk, and the shorter the time taken to drink the alcohol, the higher will be the blood alcohol concentration.

Normally, one drink results in a blood alcohol concentration in the range of 20–30 mg/% and then the alcohol is completely broken down (metabolised) over a period of two hours. After two drinks, the usual blood alcohol concentration is in the range of 40 to 50 mg/% and the alcohol is broken down in four hours, and so on.

Drinking a lot of alcohol fast results in a high blood alcohol concentration.

### 5-18 How does maternal weight affect the blood alcohol concentration?

Each drink results in a higher blood alcohol concentration in women with a low weight than in women who weigh more. Heavier women, therefore, can usually drink more than light women before they become drunk.

Note
:	A mother’s weight is related to the amount of water in her body (her total body water). The volume of alcohol drunk passes into all the body water within 20 minutes. A large or heavy person has a large amount of body water and this dilutes the alcohol and reduces the blood alcohol concentration. The reverse is true for a small individual who has less body water to dilute the alcohol, resulting in a higher blood alcohol concentration.

### 5-19 How does food intake affect the blood alcohol concentration?

Food, especially carbohydrate foods such as bread, rice or maize products, reduces the absorption of alcohol from the stomach after drinking. This keeps the blood alcohol concentration lower. Drinking without eating, therefore, results in a higher blood alcohol concentration.

### 5-20 How does smoking and other drug abuse affect the blood alcohol concentration?

When smoking cigarettes and drinking occur together, a higher blood alcohol concentration can be expected than when the same amount of alcohol is taken alone. Similarly, smoking marijuana (dagga) or taking other drugs together with alcohol also raises the blood alcohol concentration. Therefore, the risk of fetal alcohol syndrome is higher if a woman both drinks alcohol and abuses other drugs during pregnancy.

All smoking during pregnancy is strongly contra-indicated as smoking alone may cause poor fetal growth and be a factor in causing such defects as cleft-lip and cleft palate.

### 5-21 How do genetic factors affect the blood alcohol concentration?

Alcohol is broken down in the liver by enzymes. These enzymes occur in two forms. They may either break down alcohol fast or slowly. Fast-acting enzymes, which break down alcohol rapidly, result in a lower than expected blood alcohol concentration for the amount of alcohol taken. The opposite is true for the slow-acting form of the enzymes which break down alcohol slowly resulting in a higher than expected blood alcohol concentration. The rate at which a mother’s liver breaks down alcohol is determined by whether she has inherited fast- or slow-acting enzymes from her parents. Although fetal alcohol syndrome is not an inherited defect, individuals with slow-acting enzymes are at an increased risk of having an infant with fetal alcohol syndrome.

Note
:	Two separate enzymes are involved with metabolising alcohol. The first-step enzyme breaks alcohol down to acetaldehyde while the second-step enzyme breaks down acetaldehyde to carbon dioxide and water. A rapid first-step enzyme followed by a slow second-step enzyme may result in high concentrations of acetaldehyde, which causes nausea in the person who is drinking. Due to these unpleasant side effects, this usually results in smaller amounts of alcohol being drunk by the person with this combination of enzymes. As a result, they usually have a lower blood alcohol concentration. Antabuse, the drug used to stop alcoholics from drinking, uses this mechanism by interfering with the second-step enzyme (slowing it) to produce nausea and vomiting in a person who ‘sneaks’ a drink.

### 5-22 How does maternal malnutrition affect the blood alcohol concentration?

Maternal undernutrition usually results in an individual with a low body weight. As a result, these women tend to have a higher blood alcohol concentration than a heavier woman who has drunk the same amount. Also, certain trace elements and minerals, such as iron and zinc, may be at lower than normal levels in a malnourished person. Both of these minerals are important in the breakdown of alcohol in the liver, and deficiencies of iron or zinc may, therefore, result in a higher blood alcohol concentration.

A higher blood alcohol concentration is expected in women who are underweight, smoke and do not eat when they drink.

### 5-23 Does maternal age affect the risk of fetal alcohol syndrome?

Heavy drinking during pregnancy at any age may cause fetal alcohol syndrome. However, drinkers tend to drink more as they get older and, therefore, the risk of fetal alcohol syndrome increases with maternal age. Maternal nutrition, poverty and general health also tend to become worse over time in heavy drinkers.

This may explain why older mothers may give birth to an infant with fetal alcohol syndrome even if they delivered normal infants when they were young.

Recognising infants with fetal alcohol syndrome

### 5-24 What are the major features of fetal alcohol syndrome?

A history of the mother drinking heavily during pregnancy.

Microcephaly and low birth weight.

Characteristic facial features.

Slower growth than expected, both before and after delivery.

Developmental delay, intellectual disability and behaviour problems.

Congenital malformations.

### 5-25 Can infants with fetal alcohol syndrome be recognised at birth?

Yes. Infants with fetal alcohol syndrome can often be recognised at birth as they have typical facial features. The nurse or doctor delivering the infant, or examining the infant after birth, can recognise the condition. Infants with fetal alcohol syndrome are often jittery, irritable and appear anxious after delivery. If the mother drank throughout the pregnancy, this abnormal behaviour could be due to the sudden withdrawal of alcohol to the infant after delivery.

Fetal alcohol syndrome should always be expected if the mother gives a history of heavy drinking during pregnancy. However, when mothers are not suspected of heavy drinking in pregnancy, the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome may be missed.

If the doctor is not sure whether the infant has fetal alcohol syndrome, the infant’s growth and development should be monitored before confirming the diagnosis. It is important to be sure of the diagnosis before labelling an infant as having fetal alcohol syndrome. It is therefore important to refer the infant for further follow-up, e.g. developmental assessment at a later stage.

### 5-26 At what age is it easiest to diagnose fetal alcohol syndrome?

Although the condition can be recognised at birth, the clinical features of fetal alcohol syndrome often become more obvious when the children are between three and 10 years of age. Therefore, many of these children are only diagnosed in childhood.

### 5-27 What are the characteristic facial appeances of a newborn infant and child with fetal alcohol syndrome?

The most important facial signs are:

Narrow (short) palpebral fissures (distance between the inner and outer corner of the eye).

A narrow pink border (vermillion border) of the upper lip (the visible pink part of the upper lip, i.e. the area where a woman puts her lipstick).

Long, smooth upper lip with no vertical ridge (philtrum) between the nose and the lip.

Other less common signs include:

Flattened nasal bridge with epicanthic folds.

Short upturned nose.

Small chin (micrognathia).

Deep creases down both sides of the mouth when the infant cries.

Flattened cheekbones.

Note
:	A formal scoring system can be used to include all dysmorphic features present. The higher the score the more likely the diagnosis of fetal alcohol sysndrome or partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

Note
:	Other features of FAS include, ptosis (droopy eyelid), abnormally shaped teeth, a low hairline over the forehead and nape of the neck (hirsutism), and minor ear abnormalities. They may also have a cleft palate.

### 5-28 Why do infants with fetal alcohol syndrome all look alike?

Most facial features of fetal alcohol syndrome are due to poor development of the mid-face, giving the typical appearance. The short upturned nose, long smooth upper lip without a philtrum, narrow pink border of the upper lip and small chin are due to underdevelopment of the middle of the face.

The philtrum consisting of two narrow ridges which normal infants have running from the base of their nose to the centre of the upper lip. This is often missing or smooth in infants with fetal alcohol syndrome.

When infants with fetal alcohol syndrome cry, the pink part of the upper lip becomes stretched and thin. They also often have deep creases down both sides of their mouth which are not seen when the infant is not crying. Most of the facial features of fetal alcohol syndrome are more obvious when the infant cries.

### 5-29 Do the facial features of fetal alcohol syndrome change with age?

Yes. The facial features do change with age, and the most useful time to recognise them is between three and 10 years. Before and after this time the typical features are less obvious. After 10 years the facial features appear more normal although the palpebral fissures and ptosis remain for life.

With increasing age the flattening of the bridge of the nose fills out and becomes less noticeable while the nose and jaw become longer. If the face of an adolescent or adult with fetal alcohol syndrome is viewed from the side, there is blunting of the tip of the nose, a long upper lip and characteristic jutting shape to the jaw.

Experience is needed to notice these features.

### 5-30 May the pattern of drinking during pregnancy affect the facial appearance of the infant with fetal alcohol syndrome?

Yes. If the mother drinks heavily throughout her pregnancy, but especially between four and 10 weeks of gestation, the characteristic facial appearance will be present. However, if the mother only drinks after the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, her infant may have a normal face. A confident diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome then becomes very difficult.

If a woman drinks heavily between four and 10 weeks of pregnancy, her infant will be at high risk of having the characteristic facial appearance of fetal alcohol syndrome.

### 5-31 Do infants with fetal alcohol syndrome have small eyes?

Their eyes are usually of a normal size. However, their eyes appear small because they have narrow palpebral fissures (the distance between the inner and outer corners of the eye).

Note
:	Recent studies suggest that children with fetal alcohol syndrome do have smaller eyes than normal as part of their microcephaly.

### 5-32 How can the length of the palpebral fissures be measured?

The length of the palpebral fissure can be measured with a ruler. However, this requires special training and is usually only done at a genetic clinic. It is easier done in older children.

Growth and development in infants with fetal alcohol syndrome

### 5-33 What is the pattern of growth deficiency in newborn infants who have fetal alcohol syndrome?

Growth deficiency begins with the fetus and can be measured by serial antenatal ultrasound scans throughout pregnancy. As a result, these infants often have a low birth weight (weigh less than 2500 g at birth). Usually their weight, length and head circumference at birth all fall below the 10th centile for gestational age. They are, therefore, underweight and short for their gestational age (stunted) with small heads. Infants with fetal alcohol syndrome often have a head circumference which is lower than their weight or length on the centile charts (microcephaly).

Infants with fetal alcohol syndrome are growth restricted at birth.

### 5-34 What are the typical growth problems seen in older children with fetal alcohol syndrome?

Usually the infant’s weight, length and head circumference remain below the 10th percentile. This pattern of slow growth continues in the infant after delivery, even if the child receives a good diet. As a result, mothers of children with fetal alcohol syndrome are often accused of not feeding their children properly.

Both head circumference and length (height) remain less than expected throughout childhood and adolescence, resulting in short adult stature with a small head. The increase in body weight is also slow although girls may become obese at puberty. Boys tend to remain underweight into adulthood.

Children with fetal alcohol syndrome are short with small heads.

### 5-35 What is the effect of alcohol on brain growth and devepment?

Head circumference is a good measure of brain size and is often used to assess brain growth. Slow brain growth results in slow head growth. This can be demonstrated in the fetus with serial antenatal ultrasound scans. After delivery, slow brain growth can be recorded by measuring head circumference with a tape and plotting it on a centile chart.

Heavy drinking during pregnancy will slow down brain growth. Depending on the amount and timing, alcohol abuse can result in microcephaly. As well as reducing brain growth, alcohol also damages the brain, especially when alcohol is drunk in the first trimester. Deficient growth and structural damage to the developing brain have serious consequences for the intelligence and behaviour of people with fetal alcohol syndrome.

Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can restrict fetal brain growth and development.

### 5-36 Are all people with fetal alcohol syndrome intellectually disabled?

Yes. All people with fetal alcohol syndrome are intellectually disabled with an average intelligence (IQ) of 60–70, which is in the mild intellectual disability range (average IQ in normal people is 100). Worldwide, fetal alcohol syndrome is one of the most common preventable causes of intellectual disability.

Infants and children with fetal alcohol syndrome are developmentally delayed. Their motor milestones are often slow and their motor coordination poor. They also have learning and behaviour problems.

Fetal alcohol syndrome is one of the common preventable causes of intellectual disability world wide.

### 5-37 What language problems are common in children with fetal alcohol syndrome?

Children with fetal alcohol syndrome have delayed language development. However, once they learn to speak, they are often very talkative although the content is very simple and sentence construction poor.

Hearing loss or deafness, and cleft lip or palate can worsen speech problems. These can also affect the rate of acquiring speech and pronunciation. Hearing loss or deafness may be due to recurrent ear infections, fluid behind the eardrums (chronic serous otitis media) or congenital deafness due to nerve damage.

### 5-38 What behaviour problems are common in children with fetal alcohol syndrome?

Behaviour problems are very common. Infants are often irritable, cry a lot and have feeding difficulties. This may affect the mother–infant relationship and increases the risk of physical abuse.

Children with fetal alcohol syndrome commonly:

Have sleeping problems.

Are unable to learn from past mistakes.

Have a lack of sense of danger.

Have poor concentration (attention deficit disorder).

Are hyperactive.

Have poor memory.

These behavioural abnormalities result in children with fetal alcohol syndrome having:

School learning problems. The behaviour problems, especially the poor concentration and hyperactivity associated with intellectual disability, result in school failure and the need for special education.

Problems from an early age integrating into society. Stealing, lying, aggression and other abnormal activities are common. These children are often easily influenced by others to take part in anti-social (e.g. alcohol and drug abuse) and criminal activities. They often suffer from anxiety and low self-esteem and have difficulty finding employment as adults. Children with fetal alcohol syndrome often become ‘street children’.

Social development is seriously affected by the behaviour abnormalities, even if these children are placed in stable homes.

Note
:	Poor concentration and hyperactivity in children are also known as attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

### 5-39 What learning problems are common in children with fetal alcohol syndrome?

Most children with fetal alcohol syndrome have general learning problems, especially with language, reading, writing, arithmetic and problem solving. Failing at school is common. The poor home environment also adds to the learning and behaviour problems as does attention deficit disorder.

Children with fetal alcohol syndrome have serious life long physical, emotional, intellectual and behaviour problems.

### 5-40 What is alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder?

Children who are exposed to alcohol only after the first trimester do not suffer the serious effects of alcohol on developing organs. They do not have the typical fetal alcohol face and congenital malformations. However, alcohol later in pregnancy still has harmful effects on brain and body growth resulting in microcephaly and stunting. These children are classified as Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder or Alcohol-Related Neurological Defect or (ARND) and not Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Because they do not have the typical facial features, they may be difficult to diagnose.

### 5-41 What congenital malformations are associated with fetal alcohol syndrome?

The following malformations are associated with fetal alcohol syndrome:

Congenital heart defects. This is the commonest associated malformation. The defect seen most often is ventricular septal defect (VSD) followed by atrial septal defect (ASD).

Skeletal abnormalities. These include radio-ulnar synostosis (bony fusion of the two bones seen on X-ray in older children and adults), neural tube defects, vertebral abnormalities, abnormal fingers (4th and 5th), and pectus excavatum (funnel chest).

Cleft lip and palate. Usually only a cleft palate is present. This is not common. Therefore examination of the palate with a torch and spatula is necessary if the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome is suspected.

### 5-42 Is there a test for fetal alcohol syndrome?

Unfortunately there is no specific biological test for fetal alcohol syndrome. Therefore, a blood test cannot be used to screen children for this disorder. It is a clinical diagnosis based on a careful general examination plus a history of the mother taking alcohol during pregnancy and a neurodevelopmental assessment. Great care must be taken in making the correct diagnosis as it has serious implications for the person with fetal alcohol syndrome and the family.

Care of children with fetal alcohol syndrome and their families

### 5-43 What care is available for people with fetal alcohol syndrome?

People with fetal alcohol syndrome, as with all people with congenital disability, should be offered the ‘best possible patient care’ available. This includes care of their medical problems and meeting their special needs:

It is important to make and confirm the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome as early as possible. This allows for early counselling to inform parents about the disorder and available treatment, and helps them come to terms with the many problems and to emotionally bond with their child. It also allows for an early start to treatment and intervention programmes. This will ensure the best long-term outcome for the person’s health, development and intellectual ability.

Newborns should be kept warm and fed early to prevent hypoglycaemia and hypothermia caused by their intra-uterine growth restriction.

Ear infections are common. They should be diagnosed early and treated correctly with antibiotics.

Behaviour problems should be managed. This is a specialised area of treatment and people with fetal alcohol syndrome should be referred to special units if possible.

Children with congenital heart defects may need to be treated for heart failure.

Surgical repair for congenital heart defects may be needed. Infants and children, suspected of having congenital heart defects, should be sent for cardiac assessment.

Other congenital malformations such as cleft lip or palate will need surgical correction.

People with fetal alcohol syndrome, like all people with disability, should get the best possible care available for them.

### 5-44 How should developmental and behavioural problems be managed?

These children should be offered neurodevelopmental therapy and community-based rehabilitation. Infants and children with fetal alcohol syndrome develop slowly, are intellectually disabled and have behaviour problems. Their successful integration into society, including schooling and finding employment, is difficult and will be greatly improved by early diagnosis and intervention. This includes:

Physiotherapy to assist those infants with slow motor milestones to achieve their motor milestones faster.

Hearing assessment (audiology) and speech therapy. Infants and children with fetal alcohol syndrome have delayed speech development and this may be worsened by hearing loss from recurrent ear infections or congenital auditory (hearing) nerve damage. Hearing must be checked if deafness is suspected. Speech therapy helps them to develop better speech faster.

Occupational therapy. Fine motor co-ordination and personal and social development can be improved by an occupational therapist.

Neurodevelopmental therapy in all its forms is available in major centres. However, in less resourced rural and urban regions, this may only be available in the form of community-based rehabilitation. In South Africa, community-based rehabilitation for infants and children with disability can be assisted by the use of a locally produced stimulation program called START.

Information on START can be obtained from: Sunshine Centre, P O Box 41167, Craighall, 2024. Telephone 011 642 2005.

### 5-45 Should children with fetal alcohol syndrome go to school?

All children with fetal alcohol syndrome should have the opportunity of going to school, despite the fact that they will have school learning problems. In South Africa at present, the Department of Education’s policy is ‘inclusive’ education for children with mild intellectual disability. The aim of the policy is to allow disabled children to attend normal schools where they will be integrated into the education programme to the greatest extent possible, but will also have available the specialised attention they need. Because of their behaviour problems it may be necessary for the caregivers to work together with the school on the child’s educational management. The other option is for these children to go to a school for the intellectually disabled. There are a few of these special schools in South Africa.

### 5-46 Should infants with fetal alcohol syndrome be breastfed?

Yes. However, alcohol crosses into the breast milk in small amounts. Therefore, the mother should be encouraged not to drink alcohol during the period that she is breastfeeding. Emotional bonding and infant nutrition can be improved with breastfeeding, especially when the home economic conditions are poor.

### 5-47 What counselling is needed by parents who have a child with fetal alcohol syndrome?

Counselling is a major part of the care of people with fetal alcohol syndrome and their family, especially the parents. The parents need to be educated and informed about:

The diagnosis.

The cause of fetal alcohol syndrome.

The clinical features, complications and prognosis of fetal alcohol syndrome, and the treatment available.

The risk for parents with a child with fetal alcohol syndrome having another child with fetal alcohol syndrome in future pregnancies. The risk can be eliminated if the mother does not drink alcohol during all future pregnancies. If possible, she should stop drinking alcohol completely.

The parents, family and child with fetal alcohol syndrome need to be offered on-going psychosocial support as with all individuals who have a congenital disability. They suffer lifelong problems which require lifelong care including support. The burden of the disorder is experienced not only by the affected person, but also the family, especially parents, brothers and sisters. Support, help, reassurance and care in these circumstances may be obtained from:

Doctors, nurses (especially nursing staff trained in genetics), genetic counsellors and neurodevelopmental therapists.

Teachers in special schools for the intellectually disabled.

Social workers.

The Foundation for Alcohol-Related Research (FARR). This non-governmental organisation plays a role in South Africa in advocacy, patient and parent support, and educating the public, medical and paramedical professions, social workers and educators.

### 5-48 Can fetal alcohol syndrome be prevented?

The answer is theoretically yes if the woman does not drink any alcohol when pregnant. The reality is different. It is very difficult to prevent alcohol consumption in all women who may fall pregnant. It is also difficult to persuade heavy drinkers not to drink. However, there has been some success in reducing or stopping drinking in women who have previously had a child with fetal alcohol syndrome. The alternative is to try and persuade women, who are at risk, to delay becoming pregnant by using contraception until such time as they can reduce or stop drinking alcohol

In the long term, educating the whole community about the dangers of drinking may be the best approach to preventing fetal alcohol syndrome. FARR is currently undertaking research and conducting intervention programmes in various communities in South Africa focusing on the support of pregnant women and community development and support.

Note
:	Many alcoholic drinks have a health warning on the label but it is uncertain whether this reduces the risk of fetal alcohol syndrome.

Every effort must be made to stop women drinking alcohol during pregnancy to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome.

### 5-49 How can you identify women at risk of delivering an infant with fetal alcohol syndrome?

The following factors are associated with women at high risk:

A previous child with fetal alcohol syndrome. This is the most important risk factor.

A previous child with developmental delays and a suspected history of maternal drinking during pregnancy.

Women who admit to heavy drinking.

Women with a husband or partner who drinks heavily.

Women from a community or household where alcohol is abused.

A high suspicion that the woman drinks heavily.

All women must be asked about these risk factors when they book for antenatal care. Mothers should also be asked about these risk factors if their child is suspected of having fetal alcohol syndrome. It is important not to be judgemental when taking a history of alcohol intake. The amount and frequency of alcohol drunk should be established.

### 5-50 How should women at risk of delivering an infant with fetal alcohol syndrome be managed?

They must be informed of the risk to her unborn infant.

They should be provided with the information needed to make an informed decision about her drinking, i.e. counselled.

They should be referred to the appropriate facilities or resources in the community where she can obtain help and support, e.g. social services, churches, women’s groups, schools, employers and community workers.

Women who are trying to stop abusing alcohol need the support of the whole community.

Preventing fetal alcohol syndrome is firstly a community issue, but also a national concern.

Case study 1

A mother of two normal children drinks heavily throughout her pregnancy. She tells her friends that fetal alcohol syndrome is rare and is inherited. Because her children are healthy she believes that there is no danger to her fetus.

1. How common is fetal alcohol syndrome?

Although it is believed to be rare in industrialised countries (one in 1000 births) it is common in South Africa, especially in poor communities where more than 50 per 1000 infants may be affected.

2. Is fetal alcohol syndrome inherited?

No. However, the rate at which alcohol is broken down in the body is inherited. Therefore, women who inherit a slow rate of breaking down alcohol are at an increased risk of a damaged fetus as they have higher blood concentrations of alcohol if they drink.

3. Do two normal children indicate that she has no risk of damaging this fetus with alcohol?

No. Many women who drink a lot of alcohol tend to drink even more as they get older. Therefore their later children are at a particularly high risk of fetal alcohol syndrome.

4. Would the fetus be safe if the mother only drank in the second half of pregnancy?

Alcohol in pregnancy is more dangerous in the first 10 weeks after the last menstrual period when the fetal organs are still forming. Heavy drinking during early pregnancy may, therefore, result in brain damage and congenital malformations. However, drinking in later pregnancy may still interfere with the growth and brain development of the fetus. Some infants exposed to alcohol only late in pregnancy appear normal at delivery but still have brain damage (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders or alcohol-related neurological deficit). Therefore alcohol is dangerous at any time during pregnancy.

5. Is it safe for a mother who drinks heavily to breastfeed her infant?

As small amounts of alcohol cross into the breast milk, it is best if a mother does not drink alcohol during the weeks and months that she is breastfeeding. However, alcohol in breast milk will not cause fetal alcohol syndrome.

Case study 2

A young, thin woman who is pregnant with her first child goes to a party one Saturday evening with her boyfriend and gets very drunk. They both drink five 300 ml cans of beers in less than an hour. She also smokes a few cigarettes and has very little to eat.

1. Is it dangerous if she only drinks heavily once during her pregnancy?

Taking a lot of alcohol even once during pregnancy is dangerous to a fetus. Binge drinking like this can severely damage a fetus, especially in the first trimester.

2. How much alcohol is safe for a pregnant woman to drink?

Any amount of alcohol carries a risk of fetal damage. It is best to drink no alcohol during pregnancy.

3. Does it matter how fast the alcohol is drunk?

The greater the amount of alcohol and the faster it is drunk, the higher will be the blood alcohol concentration. The higher the blood alcohol concentration, the greater the risk of damage to the fetus.

4. How can one determine how many drinks there are in five 300 ml cans of beer?

One drink is equal to one 300 ml can of beer, one 150 ml glass of wine or a 25 ml tot of spirits. One drink contains 15 ml of absolute alcohol. Therefore five beers are equivalent to five drinks (or 75 ml alcohol). This is a large amount of alcohol.

5. Are some types of alcohol less dangerous to the fetus than others?

No. The risk to the fetus depends on the amount of alcohol not on the type of drink, e.g. beer, wine or spirits.

6. What other factors may have influenced her blood alcohol concentration?

She is thin (and probably does not weigh very much), smokes and has little to eat. These factors will all result in a relatively high blood alcohol concentration.

Case study 3

A midwife notices that a newborn infant has a strange facial appearance. The infant weighs less than 2500 g at birth and the head appears particularly small. The mother admits to drinking heavily throughout her pregnancy.

1. What is the typical appearance of the face in infants with fetal alcohol syndrome?

They have short palpebral fissures and a long smooth upper lip without a philtrum. There are also deep creases down both sides of the mouth and not much pink upper lip to be seen, especially when the infant cries. Most of these, and other facial features of fetal alcohol syndrome, are due to poor growth of the central part of the face.

2. What is the size at birth of most infants born with fetal alcohol syndrome?

Most have a low birth weight (less than 2500 g). Their weight, length and especially head circumference measurements are less than expected for their gestational age (less than the 10th centile). The small head indicates that the infant’s brain has been growing slowly during pregnancy.

3. How may the pattern of drinking during pregnancy affect the appearance of the infant?

The facial abnormalities are most marked if the mother drinks heavily during the first months of pregnancy (four to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period).

4. At what age is the appearance of fetal alcohol syndrome most easy to recognise?

Although these infants can be recognised at birth, their abnormal appearance is most marked between three and 10 years of age. Most infants with fetal alcohol syndrome look similar, and with experience can be recognised.

5. What congenital malformations can be caused by heavy drinking during pregnancy?

Excessive alcohol intake during pregnancy not only damages the growth and development of the fetus but can also cause congenital malformations, especially of the heart (ventricular and atrial septal defects), skeleton and palate.

6. Is there a blood or other test that can prove the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome?

No. The diagnosis is based on the mother’s history of drinking alcohol during pregnancy, a clinical diagnosis based on specific clinical signs in the infant and a neurodevelopmental assessment. There is no specific biological test for fetal alcohol syndrome.

Case study 4

A 10-year-old child with fetal alcohol syndrome is having major schooling problems. The teacher complains of bad behaviour. The child is not able to keep up with the other normal children in the class and does not pay attention.

1. Why do children with fetal alcohol syndrome often fail at school?

All children with fetal alcohol syndrome have reduced intelligence and learning difficulties and, therefore, failing at school is common. The main problem is brain damage caused by exposure to alcohol during pregnancy. In addition, there are often many social problems at home.

2. What learning problems are common?

Children with fetal alcohol syndrome have particular problems with language, reading, writing, arithmetic and problem solving. It is, therefore, not surprising that they often fail at school.

3. What is the average intelligence of children with fetal alcohol syndrome?

Most have a low IQ (intelligence quotient) of 60 to 70. This puts them in the range of mildly intellectually disabled. Fetal alcohol syndrome is one of the most common preventable causes of intellectual disability.

4. What language difficulties occur in these children?

They have delayed language development, i.e. they learn to talk later than normal. However, once they are able to speak, they tend to be very talkative, using simple poorly constructed sentences.

5. Are behaviour problems common in fetal alcohol syndrome?

Yes, behaviour problems are common. Young infants with fetal alcohol syndrome are irritable and cry a lot which often affects the mother–infant relationship and can result in child abuse. Older children are hyperactive with poor concentration (attention deficit). Anti-social behaviour with lying, stealing and aggression may lead to criminal acts.

6. Should a child with fetal alcohol syndrome go to a normal school?

All children with fetal alcohol syndrome should go to school and, if possible, attend a normal school. As most of these children have mild intellectual disability they will need extra help. Some more seriously impaired children may need to go to a special school, if it is available.

Case study 5

Parents of a very difficult child with fetal alcohol syndrome visit a local clinic for help and advice. They want to know what can be done to help them care for the child. They also ask about the risks of having another child with fetal alcohol syndrome as they still drink heavily.

1. What care is available for children with fetal alcohol syndrome?

Parents of a child with fetal alcohol syndrome need a lot of help and psychosocial support. Neurodevelopmental therapy is important and includes physiotherapy, hearing assessment and speech therapy, and occupational therapy. Doctors, nurses, teachers and social workers all have a role to play. Comprehensive care can be offered in special units in most larger centres in South Africa. Hospital and community-based services to provide neurodevelopmental therapy and stimulation programmes are becoming available in other regions. Local support groups can be of great help.

2. Do children with fetal alcohol syndrome need special medical treatment?

Ear infections are common and need to be diagnosed and treated early. Congenital malformations such as heart defects and cleft palate will need correct treatment.

3. What factors identify a women at risk of having another child with fetal alcohol syndrome?

The most important risk factor is a previous child with fetal alcohol syndrome. However, a history or suspicion of heavy drinking from the woman, her partner or the local community is also associated with an increased risk. This should always form part of the history taken at an antenatal clinic.

4. Can fetal alcohol syndrome be prevented?

Yes. Do not drink any alcohol throughout pregnancy. This is not easy for a woman who drinks heavily. Perhaps her best option, if she cannot stop drinking, is to delay having further pregnancies, by using contraception.

5. How should this woman be helped?

She must be advised about the risk of damage to her unborn child if she drinks during pregnancy, and be given the information she needs to make an informed decision about her drinking. Both parents should be referred to a local resource in the community such as a social worker, church group or community worker. People can stop drinking but they need the help and support of the whole community if they are to succeed.

Neural tube defects

Before you begin this unit, please take the corresponding test to assess your knowledge of the subject matter. You should redo the test after you’ve worked through the unit, to evaluate what you have learned.

## Objectives

When you have completed this unit you should be able to:

Define a neural tube defect.

List the three types of neural tube defect.

Give the birth prevalence of neural tube defects.

Explain the causes of neural tube defects.

Describe the clinical features of neural tube defects.

Understand how to care for children with neural tube defects.

Understand the prevention of neural tube defects.

Introduction to neural tube defects

### 6-1 What are neural tube defects?

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are congenital malformations of the neural tube, caused by failure of the neural tube to close at the end of the fourth week after conception. Neural tube defects include the following three conditions:

Anencephaly.

Encephalocoele.

Spina bifida.

Neural tube defects are typical examples of a **multifactorial congenital malformation**. These birth defects result from an interaction between genetic factors (usually a number of inherited genes) and an environmental factor (probably viral, dietary, toxic or radiation). Multifactorial defects, such as neural tube defects, occur in both males and females.

### 6-2 What is the neural tube?

At 22 days after conception, the embryo is a flat, pear-shaped plate made up of three layers of cells. By a process of folding in the midline, the top layer of cells forms a tube within the middle layer of the plate. This tube, the neural tube, runs from top to bottom of the developing embryo and is formed by 28 days post conception.

### 6-3 What develops from the neural tube?

The neural tube is the structure from which the skull, brain, spinal cord and nerves will develop, as well as the spinal column (made up of vertebrae). If the neural tube fails to close at the head end, the defect results in **anencephaly** or an **encephalocoele**. If it fails to close lower down along the spine, the result is **spina bifida**.

Anencephaly, encephalocoele and spina bifida are the three types of neural tube defect.

### 6-4 What is anencephaly?

Anencephaly (no brain) is the most serious of all neural tube defects and always results in stillbirth or early neonatal death. The top (vault) of the skull is absent, exposing the brain, which is malformed. The cerebral hemispheres do not develop with anencephaly.

Anencephaly is called an open neural tube defect because brain (neural tissue) is exposed.

### 6-5 What is an encephalocoele?

An encephalocoele is a failure of closure in the midline of the skull anywhere from a position between the eyes (frontal area) to the back of the skull (occipital area). With an encepaholcoele the brain coverings (the meninges), with or without brain tissue, protrude through the skull defect into a membranous sac which is covered by skin. The most common site of an encephalocoele is in the occipital area. Frontal encephalocoeles are also seen.

Encephalocoeles are called closed neural tube defects because neural tissue is not exposed as the defect is covered by skin.

### 6-6 What is spina bifida?

Spina bifida (split spine) is an opening in the spinal column due to failure of closure of the bony vertebral arches. Spina bifida may occur anywhere down the spinal column. There are three forms of spina bifida:

Meningomyelocoele. This is the most severe form of spina bifida.

Meningocoele. This is a less severe than meningomyelocoele.

Spina bifida occulta. This is the least severe form as it only involves the bony spine.

Spina bifida may be either open or closed, depending on the type.

Note
:	Meningomyelocoele (or myelomeningocoele) is also referred to as spina bifida cystica while meningocoele is also called spina bifida aperta. Cystica is Latin for cyst and aperta means an opening.

### 6-7 What is a meningomyelocoele?

A meningomyelocoele is an opening anywhere along the spinal column, due to failure of one or more vertebral arches to close. Neural tissue (spinal cord and nerves) and the coverings of the spinal cord (the meninges) bulge through the opening. The skin over this defect does not close, but the defect may be covered by a thin membrane which tears easily. The neural tissue that bulges through the bony defect is usually damaged, resulting in nerve abnormalities below the level of the defect.

Meningomyelocoeles are open neural tube defects because neural tissue (spinal cord and nerves) is exposed and not covered by skin.

### 6-8 What is a meningocoele?

A meningocoele is an opening anywhere along the spinal column, due to failure of closure of one or more vertebral arches. Only the coverings of the spinal cord (the meninges) protrude through the defect, forming a sac which is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The spinal cord and nerves are normal and do not bulge through the opening. There is no associated spinal cord or nerve damage. The meningocoele usually is covered on the outside by skin.

A meningocoele is a closed neural tube defect when it is covered by skin.

### 6-9 What is spina bifida occulta?

Spina bifida occulta is a defect of the spinal column, due to failure of one or more vertebral arches to close. This usually occurs in the lumbar and sacral regions of the spine (lower back). Unlike a meningomyelocoele or meningocoele, the spinal cord and meninges are normal and do not protrude through the defect. The defect may be covered by an overlying abnormality such as a midline patch of hair, a lipoma or a dimple. Neurological abnormality is usually not associated with spina bifida occulta although spina bifida occulta may present later in life with back problems. The diagnosis of spina bifida occulta can be confirmed on X-ray which shows the defect in the spinal column.

Spina bifida occulta is a closed neural tube defect.

Note
:	Occulta is a Latin word that means hidden or secret.

### 6-10 How common are neural tube defects?

Neural tube defects occur throughout the world. Their birth prevalence (number of infants with neural tube defects per 1000 live births) varies according to the area (geographic location), the ethnicity and the socio-economic status of the population. In industrialised countries the birth prevalence of neural tube defects has decreased significantly over the last 40 to 50 years, and is now about 1/1000 live births. Of these infants about 50% spina bifida, 40% have anencephaly and 10% encephalocoeles.

In urban areas of South Africa (Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria), the birth prevalence in the Black population is about 1/1000 live births. In contrast, the birth prevalence has been recorded as 6.1/1000 in rural areas of the Eastern Cape Province and 3.6/1000 in rural Limpopo Province. The reason for the difference in birth prevalence between urban and rural populations is not known.

The prevalence (number of infants with neural tube defects per 1000 in a population) of neural tube defects in South Africa is small as most infants born with these defects die young. In rural Limpopo more than 90% of infants born with anencephaly, encephalocoele or meningomyelocoele die before the age of two years.

In black populations in South Africa, the birth prevalence of neural tube defects in urban areas is about 1/000 live births while in rural areas it is about 4/1000 live births.

Note
:	The birth prevalence of neural tube defects in industrialised countries has decreased greatly over the last 40 years as the socio-economic situation has improved and prevention strategies have been put in place. As an example, in people of Celtic origin living in Ireland, the birth prevalence of neural tube defects used to be above 6/1000 live births but is now less than 1/1000 live births.

### 6-11 What causes neural tube defects?

The development of the neural tube, including its closure, is under the control of several genes working together with environmental factors. Most neural tube defects are, therefore, caused by **multifactorial** inheritance, i.e. they result from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors.

Most neural tube defects are due to multifactorial inheritance.

Folic acid is one of the important fetal environmental factors involved in closure of the neural tube.

Folic acid is an important fetal environmental factor in the cause of neural tube defects.

### 6-12 What are the other causes of neural tube defects?

Neural tube defects can also be caused by chromosomal abnormalities, single gene defects and teratogens including alcohol and sodium valproate (Epilim or Convulex). Sodium valproate is used to treat epilepsy. Some of these drugs may cause neural tube defects by working against the effect of folic acid.

### 6-13 What are the clinical features of neural tube defects?

The clinical presentation of neural tube defects depends on the type of defect, whether it is open or closed, its position and size. The different presentations vary greatly, from no obvious clinical features in spina bifida occulta to a gross abnormality in anencephaly.

### 6-14 What are the clinical features of anencephaly?

Infants with anencephaly are often born preterm and may be stillborn. If they are live born they seldom live longer than 24 hours. The infants are born with the top of their skull missing and brain exposed. The eyes appear to bulge. General examination of the rest of the infant is usually normal but may reveal other abnormalities.

Note
:	At postmortem examination 40% of anencephalics have abnormal internal organs.

### 6-15 What are the clinical features of an encephalocoele?

An encephalocoele develops because of failure of complete closure of the skull. The infant presents at birth with a midline mass anywhere from between the eyes to the back of the skull (occiput). The most common site for an encephalocoele is over the occiput. The clinical presentation will depend on the size and site and whether the encephalocoele contains neural tissue (brain matter) or not. Encephalocoeles that only contain meninges and no neural tissue usually have problems only related to the defect in the skull. However, if the encephalocoele contains brain tissue, this can be damaged or be associated with severe brain abnormalities. The resulting neurological abnormalities will depend on the size and site of the encephalocoele. In severe cases, most of the brain may be in the encephalocoele.

Associated neurological abnormalities include:

Intellectual disability.

Microcephaly.

Cerebral palsy.

Visual disability (blindness).

Epilepsy.

Depending on the size and site of the encephalocoele, early death, even with treatment, is a common outcome in many of these infants.

### 6-16 What are the clinical features of a meningomyelocoele?

A meningomyelocoele presents at birth with a mass anywhere along the spine, but usually in the thoracic, lumbar or sacral regions. The mass may or may not be covered by a thin membrane, but neural tissue (spinal cord and nerves) is usually visible. The associated clinical features depend on the site and size of the defect.

As a meningomyelocoele contains neural tissue which is usually damaged, the body and limbs of the affected infant are paralysed below the level of the defect. The effect is similar to traumatic cutting of the spinal cord. The associated clinical features include:

Flaccid paralysis (floppiness, weakness and absent reflexes) of the legs.

No feeling (touch or pain) below the level of the defect.

Kyphosis. A forward bend in the spine. With large meningomyelocoele this may also be associated with a lateral bend (scoliosis).

Incontinence of bladder.

Incontinence of bowel.

Clubfeet.

Hydrocephalus (80% of cases). Hydrocephalus (excessive cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain) often presents in utero but may only present in the first weeks after delivery. Early diagnosis of hydrocephalus is important to obtain the best results from surgery.

Note
:	Hydrocephalus is caused by a malformation at the base of the brain, called an Arnold–Chiari malformation, where the cerebellum bulges through the opening at the base of the skull. This blocks the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid.

### 6-17 What are the complications of a meningomyelocoele?

Complications of meningomyelocoele may present early or repeatedly. These include:

Meningitis. Infection can easily and rapidly enter the nervous system through the open meningomyelocoele. Therefore, the meningomyelocoele should be carefully and aseptically covered (e.g. sterile gauze) at birth and then closed, as soon as possible, by surgery. Sometime the covering membrane may leak or rupture (tear) during delivery.

Raised intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus. Early clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure are a bulging anterior fontanelle, irritability, vomiting, and a high-pitched cry.

Intellectual disability. The hydrocephalus, which may develop before or after delivery, can result in intellectual disability. Epilepsy from the hydrocephalus may also result.

Urinary tract infections. The bladder incontinence can result in urinary tract infections in both males and females.

Bed sores. These result from the lack of feeling (sensation) and movement in the body below the meningomyelocoele.

In low resource countries, infant and early childhood death is a common outcome of meningomyelocoeles.

### 6-18 What are the clinical features of a meningocoele?

A meningocoele presents at birth with a skin-covered mass in the midline anywhere along the spine. As the spinal cord and nerves are not involved there usually are no neurological abnormalities in the trunk, limbs, bladder and bowels. However, hydrocephalus is present as a complication in 20% of infants with meningocoeles.

Hydrocephalus develops in 80% of infants with meningomyelocoele and in 20% of infants with meningocoele.

### 6-19 What are the clinical features of spina bifida occulta?

Most people with a spina bifida occulta do not know that they have a neural tube defect, i.e. it often remains hidden for life, therefore, the use of the word ‘occulta’ (hidden). They usually have no signs or symptoms. Occasionally, spina bifida occulta is diagnosed on an X-ray which is taken for some other reason. In some infants the presence of the bony defect in the vertebral arches is suggested by an overlying midline abnormality, usually a hairy patch.

Note
:	Very occasionally a child may develop neurological complications of spina bifida occulta, especially during periods of rapid growth, presenting with urinary incontinence, neurological signs of nerve damage in a limb or clawing of the toes due to weakness of muscles in the feet.

Caring for infants and children with neural tube defects

### 6-20 What care is available for infants with neural tube defects?

The care required will depend on the type of neural tube defect, its site and size, and the available health facilities. In all patients the best possible care available must be given. This will include:

*Diagnosis*

Because of the obvious physical features of most forms of neural tube defect the diagnosis is made at birth or shortly thereafter. The exception is spina bifida occulta which is usually not clinically obvious at birth.

*Treatment*

Infants with anencephaly do not survive and are given palliative (hospice) care with warmth, feeds if hungry and support for the parents.

Medical treatment:

Medical treatment may be needed for the complications of encephalocoele, and meningomyelocoele. These include:

Antibiotics for meningitis if it develops in infants with a meningomyelocoele.

Antibiotics for urinary tract infections in meningomyelocoele.

Recurrent catheterisation for urinary incontinence in meningomyelocoele.

Anticonvulsants for epilepsy in encephalocoele.

Surgical treatment:

Infants with encephalocoele, meningomyelocoele and meningocoele should be referred to a neurosurgical unit for assessment. Meningocoeles should be simply covered with a piece of sterile gauze after delivery to reduce the risk of infection before surgery.

In encephalocoeles, meningo­myelocoeles and meningocoeles, surgery is used to close the defect and remove the mass caused by the protruding brain, spinal cord or meninges. Care is taken not to damage the spinal cord and nerves in the repair of meningocoeles nor cause further damage to the brain in encephalocoeles that contain neural tissue. These infants with neural tube defects need to be referred to a tertiary care hospital for surgical assessment as soon as possible after birth.

In meningomyelocoeles and meningocoeles, surgery to insert a ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt to treat hydrocephalus may be required. A shunt is a tube that drains the fluid from the ventricles of the brain into the abdomen. If the affected infant does not have hydrocephalus at birth, it may develop after the spinal defect is repaired. Therefore, regular careful head circumference measurements must be taken and plotted on a centile chart to help make the diagnosis of hydrocephalus as early as possible (head circumference measurements weekly for the first six weeks and then monthly to one year of age). If ultrasound facilities are available, serial head ultrasound examination can be used to assist in the diagnosis.

*Neurodevelopmental therapy*

Neurodevelopmental therapy includes physiotherapy, hearing assessment (audiology) and speech therapy, and occupational therapy. One or more of these therapies may be needed. All these forms of neurodevelopmental therapy are available in major centres. However, in both rural and urban areas with fewer resources, hospitals may only have a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist. Some may also have a community-based rehabilitation programme.

In South Africa, rehabilitation for infants and children with disabilities can be assisted by the use of a locally produced stimulation programme called START (Strive Towards Achieving Results Together). This was designed to use affordable, locally available, materials. Information on START can be obtained from: Sunshine Centre, P O Box 41167, Craighall, 2024. Telephone 011 642 2005. Internet: [www.sunshine.org.za](http://www.sunshine.org.za)

*Genetic counselling and psychosocial support*

This is an important part of the care of people with neural tube defects and their families.

Genetic counselling for neural tube defects

### 6-21 What genetic counselling is needed by parents who have a child with a neural tube defect?

Genetic counselling is a very important part of the care of people with neural tube defects and their family, especially the parents and siblings. The parents need to be educated and informed about:

The diagnosis.

The cause of neural tube defects. They need to know that neural tube defects are usually the results of multifactorial inheritance, but occasionally have other causes. It is important to rule out these other causes if possible.

The clinical features, complications and prognosis of the particular neural tube defect their child has, and what treatment is available.

The increased risk for parents of a child with a neural tube defect of having another child with a neural tube defect in future pregnancies. They need to know their options for reducing their risk of having another affected child through primary prevention, genetic screening, prenatal diagnosis and genetic counselling.

The parents, family and child with a neural tube defect need to be offered on-going psychosocial support, as do all individuals who have a congenital disability. They have problems that require lifelong care. The burden of the disorder and the care is experienced not only by the affected person, but also the family, especially parents, brothers and sisters.

### 6-22 Where can parents who have a child with a neural tube defect get support?

Support, help and reassurance may be obtained from:

Doctors, nurses (especially nursing staff with genetic training), genetic counsellors and neurodevelopmental therapists.

Social workers.

The Southern African Inherited Disorders Association (SAIDA).

Parent Support Group.

The Southern African Inherited Disorders Association (SAIDA) can be contacted at the Division of Human Genetics, National Health Laboratory Service, P O Box 1038, Johannesburg, 2000, South Africa. Telephone and fax 011 4899213.

Prevention of neural tube defects

### 6-23 Can neural tube defects be prevented?

Yes. There are two approaches for the prevention of neural tube defects. These are:

Primary prevention: This aims to ensure the conception of infants without neural tube defects. The pre-conception approach is the preferred method of prevention. It is based on the knowledge, confirmed in Europe in the early 1990s, that if a woman takes periconceptional folic acid supplements, she can reduce her risk of having an infant with a neural tube defect by 50 percent. It was also confirmed, that if a woman had previously had an infant with a neural tube defect, her increased risk of having another child with a neural tube defect could be decreased by 70 percent.

Note
:	Research done recently in China showed that periconceptional folic acid supplementation taken by women in the poorer, more rural, northern region where the birth prevalence of neural tube defects is greater than 6/1000 live births, reduced the birth prevalence by 80 percent. In the southern, wealthier and more urban part of China, where the birth prevalence of neural tube defects is about 1/1000, live births periconceptional folic acid reduced the birth prevalence by 40 percent.

Secondary prevention: This is based on genetic screening, prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects, and genetic counselling.

Many neural tube defects can be prevented by periconceptional folic acid, and by genetic screening, prenatal diagnosis and genetic counselling.

### 6-24 What is periconceptional folic acid supplementation?

Folic acid is a group B vitamin. It is very cheap and safe to give as it has few and only minor side effects even in large doses.

If folic acid is given as a medicine in the form of a pill, capsule or tablet, this is called **supplementation**.

With periconceptional supplementation folic acid is given around the period of conception, i.e. for three months before and three months after conception. This is the recommendation. However, even if the folic acid is given for only a month, there is some benefit.

The recommended dose of folic acid to prevent the occurrence of neural tube defects is a minimum of 0.4 mg daily. This can be taken alone or in combination with other vitamins in a multivitamin tablet. One periconceptional multivitamin tablet containing folic acid a day is recommended.

Vitamins A and D, if given to a pregnant mother in high doses, are teratogenic and can damage the fetus. Therefore, more than one multivitamin tablet a day can be dangerous for the fetus and the mother.

### 6-25 Does a mother who previously had an infant with a neural tube defect need more periconceptional folic acid?

Yes. If a mother had a previous child with a neural tube defect she is at greater risk for having another infant with a neural tube defect in future pregnancies. To reduce this increased risk for an infant with a neural tube defect it is recommended that she take 1 mg of folic acid daily for three months before conception and for three months after conception in all future pregnancies.

### 6-26 Is supplementation the only way that folic acid can be given?

No. As many pregnancies are not planned, it is important to put folic acid into a staple food to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. When an essential nutritional factor, such as folic acid, is added to the diet of the general population in this manner, this is called food **fortification**. Research of folic acid fortification of flour and other wheat products (from Canada, the USA, Chile and South Africa) has shown that this reduces the birth prevalence of neural tube defects.

In South Africa maize meal and wheat flour are now fortified by law with folic acid. Since the start of fortification in 2004 there has been a more than 30% decrease in the birth prevalence of neural tube defects.

Although food fortification with folic acid is being done, it is recommended that women still take periconceptional folic acid supplementation as some people may not get sufficient folic acid from fortification.

Periconceptional supplementation and food fortification with folic acid reduces the birth prevalences of neural tube defects.

### 6-27 What are the risks for a mother who has an infant with a neural tube defect having a further affected child?

Women who have previously had an infant with a neural tube defect of multifactorial origin are at greater risk of having future children affected with the same type of neural tube defect. This is also true for the children of a parent who has a neural tube defect. The risks involved in these situations are:

Family relationship	Approximate risk

One affected sibling (brother or sister)	5% (1 in 20)

Two affected siblings	10% (1 in 10)

Three affected siblings	20% (1 in 5)

One affected parent	5% (1 in 20)

One affected second degree relative (uncle or aunt)	2% (1 in 50)



Note
:	With three or more affected siblings, consideration must be given to the possibility of autosomal recessive inheritance, and if the affected siblings are all male, to X-linked recessive inheritance.

Although most neural tube defects are caused by multifactorial inheritance, care must always be taken to exclude other causes of neural tube defects before genetic counselling, including risk assessment, is given.

Screening for neural tube defects

### 6-28 How can neural tube defects be screened for during pregnancy?

There are a number of methods which can be used to screen the fetus for neural tube defects. In countries that have well organised screening programmes, all fetuses with anencephaly and 70–80% of fetuses with spina bifida can be detected. The screening includes:

Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening.

Fetal ultrasound screening.

### 6-29 What is maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening?

Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are significantly raised in ‘open’, but not in ‘closed’, neural tube defects. This is why different types of neural tube defects are classified into ‘open’ or ‘closed’ defects. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening will not detect ‘closed’ defects.

Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening is best performed at around 16 weeks (between 15 and 18 weeks) gestation on a sample of the mother’s blood. It is important to ensure that the gestational age is correct. Ultrasound dating of the fetus confirms the gestation based on the date of the last menstrual period. A raised serum level of alpha-fetoprotein indicates a high risk for an open fetal neural tube defect.

Note
:	The maternal serum screening for Down syndrome (the Triple Test) measures the concentration of maternal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated oestriol (uE3) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). The level of alpha-fetoprotein in the Triple Test can be used to screen for neural tube defects.

	Other fetal causes of a raised maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein include incorrect estimation of the gestational age, multiple pregnancy, exomphalos, nephrotic syndrome, fetal death, Turner syndrome, ectodermal dysplasia and Rhesus disease. Maternal causes include diabetes, liver or gut cancer, and hepatitis. Rarely no cause for a raised alpha fetoprotein can be found. The prognosis of these pregnancies is poor.

### 6-30 What is fetal ultrasound screening?

It is recommended that a screening ultrasound scan for fetal abnormalities is done at 18 weeks gestation (18–23 weeks). During this scan signs of neural tube defects should be detected by an experienced ultrasonographer. Fetal ultrasound scanning can detect both open and closed neural tube defects.

Whenever a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening test is abnormal, a fetal ultrasound examination must be done to decide whether a neural tube defect or other birth defect is present or not.

Note
:	Occasionally, the level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein is raised but a neural tube defect cannot be seen on fetal ultrasound examination. This may be because the neural tube defect is small and cannot be detected by ultrasound scan, or the raised alpha-fetoprotein is due to some other cause. In this situation the mother, preferably with her partner, should receive genetic counselling and be offered an amniocentesis. If the amniocentesis is accepted and performed, the amniotic fluid levels of alpha-fetoprotein and acetyl-cholinesterase are measured. If these are raised, and no other obvious cause for their being raised can be found, then the diagnosis can be considered to be a neural tube defect.

### 6-31 What is the management if the fetus has a neural tube defect?

If a prenatal diagnosis of a neural tube defect is confirmed, the woman, preferably with her partner, should urgently receive genetic counselling regarding the diagnosis and their choices of management. For women at increased risk, or with a prenatal diagnosis of a neural tube defect, the choice of which options to take is theirs alone. Many will choose a termination of pregnancy. Their medical care providers must respect this choice. Parents must also know that no matter what their choice, this will not influence their future routine care.

With genetic screening and prenatal diagnosis people are entitled to genetic counselling and always have the right of choice.

Case study 1

A female infant is born at term and a severe abnormality is noticed by the midwife as soon as the infant is delivered. A doctor is called to examine the infant. She notices that the top of the infant’s skull is missing and the brain is visible. The parents are told that their infant has a serious birth defect.

1. What is a neural tube defect?

It is an abnormality of the neural tube which does not close correctly towards the end of the first month after conception. The neural tube is a structure in the embryo from which the brain, spinal cord, spinal column and nerves develop.

2. What are the forms of neural tube defect that affect the brain?

Anencephaly.

Encephalocoele.

3. Which form of neural tube defect is present in this infant?

Anencephaly. This results from failure of closure of the midline of the skull, exposing the brain. The brain is always very abnormal with most of it (the cerebral hemispheres) missing.

4. Will this infant survive?

No. Infants with anencephaly are usually stillborn or die in the first day of life.

5. Are all infants with anencephaly females?

No. All forms of neural tube defect, including anencephaly, may occur equally in both male and female infants.

6. What are the clinical features of an encephalocoele?

An encephalocoele is less severe than anencephaly. In an encephalocoele, only part of the skull does not close completely in the midline. As a result, the meninges and often part of the brain push through the hole in the skull. Unlike anencephaly, which is an open neural tube defect, encephalocoeles are closed neural tube defects as they are covered with skin. The defect is usually in the occipital region but may also occur in the frontal region.

Case study 2

After delivery, a newborn infant is noticed to have an abnormality over the lower spine and also has club feet. The infant has a big head and does not move his legs. Otherwise he appears healthy and feeds well at the breast.

1. What is the diagnosis?

The infant has spina bifida. This is a defect in the spinal column due to failure of one or more vertebral arches to close normally. The defect is usually in the lower spine (lumbosacral region).

2. What are the forms of spina bifida?

Meningomyelocoele.

Meningocoele.

Spina bifida occulta.

This infant must have a meningomyelocoele because the nerves to the legs have been damaged. As a result he has paralysed legs and club feet.

3. What are the clinical features of a meningomyelocoele?

A midline mass which is covered by a thin membrane. Neural tissue is visible through the membrane. A meningomyelocoele is not covered with skin.

4. Why does this infant have a big head?

About 80% of infants with a meningo­myelocoele develop a hydrocephalus. This may be present at birth but can also develop in early infancy.

5. Why is this not a meningocoele?

A meningocoele is a less severe defect as only the meninges bulge through the hole in the vertebral column. As there is no neural tissue in the meningocoele, there usually will be no paralysis of the legs. A meningocoele is covered with skin. Therefore, it is called a ‘closed’ defect and would not be detected with a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screen.

6. What is a spina bifida occulta?

This is a mild form of spina bifida, which is often not noticed clinically. There is a small defect in the arch of a vertebra but the meninges do not prolapse. There may be a patch of hair or abnormal skin over the defect.

Case study 3

A young couple, who plan to start a family, visit their general practitioner, as they want to know about neural tube defects. Their neighbour recently delivered an infant with a meningocoele. The defect was successfully corrected by surgery.

1. How common are neural tube defects?

In industrialised countries the prevalence of neural tube defects is about 1/1000 live births. In rural populations in South Africa, the birth prevalence is about 4/1000.

2. What is the cause of neural tube defects?

The failure of the neural tube to close normally is usually due to multifactorial inheritance. The influence of several genes, acting together with environmental factors, results in the birth defect. Rarely, the neural tube defect may be due to chromosomal or single gene defects, or teratogens.

3. What is the most important environmental factor that plays a role in causing neural tube defects?

Folic acid. A relative lack of folic acid in the diet may act together with genetic factors to result in neural tube defects.

4. How can the frequency of neural tube defects be lowered in a community?

By fortifying an essential food, such as maize meal or wheat flour, with folic acid. Fortification of maize meal in South Africa started in 2004 and has reduced the birth prevalence of neural tube defect by more than 30%.

5. What is the correct management of a child with a meningomyelocoele?

Urgent referral to a neurosurgical unit for assessment. A meningomyelocoele should be covered with sterile gauze after birth.

Case study 4

A young mother has a child with a meningomyelocoele. She and her partner want another child but are unsure of the risk of further children also having a neural tube defect. They attend a genetic clinic for counselling.

1. What is the risk of this woman having another child with a neural tube defect?

There is an increased risk if there is a family history of neural tube defects. If a previous child has a neural tube defect the risk is 5% (1 in 20).

2. How can she lower the risk of having another affected child?

She should take 1 mg folic acid daily until she falls pregnant and then continue to take folic acid until three months after conception.

3. How effective is periconceptional folic acid supplementation in lowering the risk for another neural tube defect?

It should significantly lower the risk of neural tube defect by up to 70%.

4. How can a pregnant woman be screened for a fetus with a neural tube defect?

Either with maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screen around 16 weeks of pregnancy or by fetal ultrasound scanning at around 18 weeks of pregnancy. Ultrasound examination is also used to confirm gestational age needed for maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening.

5. Should all women planning a pregnancy take periconceptional supplements?

It is recommended that all women take at least 0.4 mg folic acid daily for three months before and three months after falling pregnant. This is often taken in the form of one multivitamin tablet containing folic acid daily, and could lower the risk of having an infant with a neural tube defect by up to 50%. However, most women falling pregnant in South Africa are provided with extra folic acid through the fortification of maize meal.

6. What should parents do if the fetus is found to have a neural tube defect?

They must be referred for genetic counselling.
