# Test 5: Fetal alcohol syndrome

1.	Fetal alcohol syndrome can be diagnosed by:
	*	Doing an abdominal X-ray during pregnancy.
	*	Doing a breathalyser test on the mother.
	*	Performing a blood test on the mother in labour.
	*	Clinical examination of the infant after birth.
2.	Fetal alcohol syndrome is associated with:
	*	Drinking alcohol during pregnancy.
	*	Binge drinking before pregnancy.
	*	Drinking alcohol during labour.
	*	Giving alcohol to a young child.
3.	Fetal alcohol syndrome is:
	*	An inherited condition.
	*	Caused by a chromosomal defect in the fetus.
	*	Caused by a teratogen.
	*	Caused by a lack of folic acid in a poor diet.
4.	How common is fetal alcohol syndrome in some communities in South Africa?
	*	Very common, i.e. 500/1000 (50%) pregnancies.
	*	Common, i.e. 50/1000 (5%) pregnancies.
	*	Not common, i.e. 5/1000 (0.5%) pregnancies.
	*	Rare, i.e. 1/1000 (0.1%) pregnancies.
5.	How many alcoholic drinks are usually needed to damage the fetus?
	*	Only one per day.
	*	At least three per day.
	*	At least five per day.
	*	At least ten per day.
6.	One drink (15 ml alcohol) is equal to:
	*	A quart of beer (750 ml).
	*	Half a tot of spirits (e.g. brandy).
	*	A glass of wine (150 ml).
	*	Two glasses of wine.
7.	Which type of alcoholic drink is most likely to cause fetal alcohol syndrome?
	*	Beer
	*	Wine.
	*	Spirits.
	*	All are equally dangerous.
8.	Alcohol is most dangerous to the fetus if it is drunk:
	*	In the week before conception.
	*	In the first trimester.
	*	In the second half of pregnancy.
	*	In the week before delivery.
9.	The following factor increases the risk of a high blood alcohol concentration:
	*	A low maternal weight.
	*	Drinking the alcohol slowly over a long time.
	*	Eating a meal with the drink.
	*	Inheriting an enzyme that breaks down alcohol fast.
10.	When is it easiest to recognise a child with fetal alcohol syndrome?
	*	During pregnancy.
	*	At birth.
	*	Between three and 10 years.
	*	After 10 years.
11.	Common signs of fetal alcohol syndrome are:
	*	Large eyes.
	*	A large head.
	*	Short palpebral fissures.
	*	A short upper lip.
12.	What is the typical pattern of fetal growth in fetal alcohol syndrome?
	*	Weight, length and head circumference are all reduced.
	*	Only weight is reduced (i.e. wasted).
	*	Head circumference is increased while weight and length are reduced.
	*	Weight, length and head circumference are all increased.
13.	What is the average intelligence (IQ) of children with fetal alcohol syndrome?
	*	Normal.
	*	Mildly intellectual disability (IQ 60–70).
	*	Moderate intellectual disability (IQ 50–60).
	*	Severe intellectual disability (IQ less than 50).
14.	What language problems can be expected in children with fetal alcohol syndrome?
	*	They are deaf and do not learn to speak.
	*	They only learn to use a few words and cannot be understood.
	*	There is delay in speaking.
	*	There are usually no language problems.
15.	What behaviour problems are common in children with fetal alcohol syndrome?
	*	They are often confused and get lost due to repeated fits.
	*	Stealing, lying and aggressive behaviour are common.
	*	They are happy, easy-going children.
	*	They usually do not have behaviour problems.
16.	What congenital malformations are most common in children with fetal alcohol syndrome?
	*	Neural tube defects.
	*	Very small eyes.
	*	Duodenal atresia.
	*	Congenital heart defects.
17.	Children with fetal alcohol syndrome should:
	*	Not be sent to school.
	*	Only be sent to a special school.
	*	Be sent to a normal school but need extra help.
	*	Be sent to any school.
18.	Infants with fetal alcohol syndrome should:
	*	Not be breastfed as alcohol crosses in the breast milk in large amounts.
	*	All be formula fed.
	*	Be breastfed if possible.
	*	Be breastfed as alcohol does not cross into the breast milk.
19.	Women are at high risk of having an infant with fetal alcohol syndrome if:
	*	Their previous child had fetal alcohol syndrome.
	*	They are teenagers.
	*	Their own father is an alcoholic.
	*	They drank heavily but stopped before this pregnancy.
20.	How should a woman at high risk of delivering an infant with fetal alcohol syndrome be managed?
	*	She should be sterilised (have a tubal ligation).
	*	She should be admitted to a psychiatric hospital and forced to stop drinking.
	*	She should be counselled and supported by the community.
	*	She should be treated with anticonvulsants to protect the fetus.
