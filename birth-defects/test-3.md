	*	Usually have long toes.
10.	Infants with Down syndrome typically have:
	*	Hypotonia (floppiness).
	*	Increased tone.
	*	A very good Moro reflex.
	*	Convulsions.
11.	What is the pattern of growth in children with Down syndrome during the first months of life?
	*	Commonly obese.
	*	Usually thin and wasted.
	*	Slow growth.
	*	Rapid growth.
12.	When should the parents of an infant with Down syndrome be told the diagnosis?
	*	It is best if they are left to find out for themselves that the infant is not normal.
	*	As soon as possible.
	*	When the child gets to school-going age.
	*	When the child reaches puberty.
13.	Children with Down syndrome often have:
	*	Cerebral palsy with increased muscle tone.
	*	Normal intelligence.
	*	Visual problems.
	*	Paralysis.
14.	What is a common complication of Down syndrome?
	*	Congenital heart defects.
	*	Congenital kidney failure.
	*	Congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
	*	Congenital deafness.
15.	Children with Down syndrome are at an increased risk of:
	*	Arthritis.
	*	Anaemia.
	*	Recurrent infection.
	*	Bleeding.
16.	What is the life expectancy of individuals with Down syndrome in South Africa?
	*	The same as normal people.
	*	More than half die before two years of age.
	*	At least 25% die on the first day of life.
	*	Most are stillborn.
17.	How can children with Down syndrome be helped to reach their full potential?
	*	They should be placed in a special institution as soon as they are one year old.
	*	They should not be stimulated as this is too stressful for them.
	*	They should be stimulated by their parents at home and receive early neurodevelopmental therapy.
	*	Neurodevelopmental therapy should only be started when they are ready for school.
18.	How can a pregnant woman be screened for a fetus with Down syndrome?
	*	X-ray of the mother’s abdomen to look for duodenal atresia in the fetus.
	*	Ultrasound examination at 12 weeks to look for increased skin thickness over the back of the fetal neck.
	*	A blood test at 25 weeks of gestation
	*	Measurement of symphysis-fundal height to look for abnormal fetal growth.
19.	How can the diagnosis of Down syndrome be confirmed during pregnancy?
	*	Chromosomal analysis on a sample of amniotic fluid.
	*	Triple test on the mother’s blood at 20 weeks.
	*	Ultrasound examination for ventricular septal defect (VSD).
	*	Chorionic villous biopsy to determine whether the fetus has hypothyroidism.
