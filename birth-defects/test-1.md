# Test 1: Introduction to birth defects

1.	How high is the prevalence of birth defects in developing countries?
	-	10/1000 live births.
	-	30/1000 live births.
	+	80/1000 live births.
	-	120/1000 live births.
2.	How many chromosomes are found in the cells of the human body?
	-	22
	-	23
	-	44
	+	46
3.	Females have:
	-	One X chromosome.
	-	One Y chromosome.
	+	Two X chromosomes.
	-	No X chromosomes.
4.	Ova and sperms are also called sex cells or:
	-	Zygotes.
	-	Embryos.
	+	Gametes.
	-	Genes.
5.	What is trisomy?
	+	An extra chromosome.
	-	An extra three chromosomes.
	-	A missing chromosome.
	-	An extra gene.
6.	Trisomy is usually due to:
	-	Translocation.
	+	Non-disjunction.
	-	Deletion.
	-	Mosaicism.
7.	What is an example of monosomy?
	-	Down syndrome.
	-	Edward syndrome.
	-	Patau syndrome.
	+	Turner syndrome.
8.	What is a gene?
	+	A small package of DNA.
	-	A group of chromosomes.
	-	A fertilised egg.
	-	A pair of chromosomes.
9.	What are alleles?
	+	A pair of similar genes.
	-	Single chromosomes.
	-	A substance that damages a fetus.
	-	A defect in a single gene.
10.	What is a mutation?
	+	A change in the structure of a gene.
	-	An increased number of genes.
	-	A decreased number of genes.
	-	It has nothing to do with genes.
11.	What is the chance of inheriting a dominant gene present in one parent?
	-	There is a 25% chance of inheriting the gene.
	+	There is a 50% chance of inheriting the gene.
	-	Only females pass on the gene.
	-	Only males pass on the gene.
12.	What is a recessive gene?
	-	A ‘stronger’ gene.
	+	A ‘weaker’ gene.
	-	A female gene.
	-	Always an abnormal gene.
13.	A person who has a dominant and a recessive gene for a particular physical feature or function is called:
	-	A female.
	-	Homozygous.
	+	Heterozygous.
	-	A twin.
14.	If both parents are carriers of a recessive gene, the chance of their infant inheriting both recessive genes is:
	-	1:1 (i.e. 100%).
	-	1:2 (i.e. 50%).
	+	1:4 (i.e. 25%).
	-	1:10 (i.e. 10%).
15.	Name the type of inheritance if a recessive gene is carried by females and only passed on to their male infants:
	-	Dominant inheritance.
	-	Recessive inheritance.
	-	Y-linked inheritance.
	+	X-linked inheritance.
16.	What clinical disorder is caused by a single gene defect?
	-	Cystic fibrosis.
	-	Down syndrome.
	-	Fetal alcohol syndrome.
	+	Club feet.
17.	Which of the following conditions are caused by a multifactorial inheritance?
	-	Neurofibromatosis.
	+	Neural tube defect.
	-	Thalassaemia.
	-	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD).
18.	What is a teratogen?
	-	An abnormal chromosome.
	-	An abnormal gene.
	+	Something that damages the developing organism.
	-	Something that damages a gene.
19.	When do teratogens have the most effect?
	-	The pre-implantation phase.
	+	The embryonic phase.
	-	The fetal phase.
	-	After birth.
20.	Which of the following is a teratogen?
	-	The X-chromosome.
	-	A recessive gene.
	-	A translocation.
	+	Rubella virus.
