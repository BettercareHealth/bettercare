# Diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis

Before you begin this unit, please take the corresponding test to assess your knowledge of the subject matter. You should redo the test after you’ve worked through the unit, to evaluate what you have learned.

## Objectives

When you have completed this unit you should be able to:

*	Explain the importance of special investigations in the diagnosis of tuberculosis.
*	Perform and interpret a Mantoux skin test.
*	Correctly collect a sputum sample.
*	Interpret the results of a sputum smear examination.
*	Recognise tuberculosis on a chest X-ray.
*	Give the indications for a fine needle aspiration of a lymph node, lumbar puncture and HIV screening in children with suspected tuberculosis.

## Confirming the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis

### 3-1 How is the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis confirmed?

A history of chronic cough and contact with an adult with tuberculosis must always suggest tuberculosis. However the suspected clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis is often difficult to prove, especially in children. Therefore special investigations are important to help confirm or reject the clinical diagnosis.

> Special investigations are important to confirm the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.

### 3-2 Which special investigations are important in diagnosing tuberculosis?

A number of special investigations are useful in confirming a clinically suspected diagnosis of tuberculosis.

*	Tuberculin skin test
*	Sputum smear examination
*	Sputum culture
*	Chest X-ray
*	Fine needle aspiration of a lymph node
*	Lumbar puncture

These special investigations must always be used together with a careful history and full physical examination. The tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray are particularly important.

> The diagnosis of tuberculosis in children usually depends on a careful history, clinical examination, tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray.

## Tuberculin skin tests

### 3-3 What is a tuberculin skin test?

This is a skin test done with tuberculin which contains protein from dead TB bacilli. Usually PPD (i.e. Purified Protein Derivative) in the form of tuberculin is used. It is safe as it does not contain live TB bacilli. The most accurate method of tuberculin skin testing is the Mantoux test, where a small amount of standardised PPD is injected into the skin (intradermally).

A tuberculin skin test determines whether the person has become infected with TB bacilli. Tuberculin skin tests usually become positive four to eight weeks after infection with TB bacilli.

Note
:	Another less accurate method of skin testing is the the Tine test.

> The Mantoux skin test is the preferred method of tuberculin skin testing.

### 3-4 How is the Mantoux skin test done?

A 1 ml syringe and size 26 needle are used to inject 0.1 ml of tuberculin (standardised PPD) into the skin over the inner side of the left forearm. It is very important that the tuberculin is injected into the skin and not under the skin (subcutaneously). If the tuberculin is correctly injected into the skin, a raised, pale wheal of 5 mm is formed. This is slightly painful. If no wheal is raised, the tuberculin has been injected too deep in error. Incorrect injection under the skin may make the result difficult to interpret.

### 3-5 How should you read a Mantoux skin test?

The Mantoux skin test must be read by examining the site of the test two to three days (48 to 72 hours) after it is done. The widest transverse diameter (across the arm) of induration (raised, swollen, thickened area of skin) is measured. It is important that the induration and not the area of redness is measured. The diameter of the induration is best measured with a ruler. Never guess the size of a Mantoux skin test. The result should be reported in millimeters and not simply as positive or negative.

Note
:	PPD stimulates a delayed reaction with sensitised lymphocytes being attracted to the site where they release inflammatory mediators which result in oedema and erythema.

### 3-6 How is the result of a Mantoux skin test interpreted?

There are three possibilities when interpreting a Mantoux skin test:

1.	If the diameter of induration is 0 to 4 mm the test is negative.
2.	A diameter of induration of 5 to 9 mm is intermediate.
3.	A diameter of induration of 10 mm or more is positive.

Therefore the greater the diameter the more significant is the result.

> A Mantoux skin test of 10 mm or more is positive.

### 3-7 What is the meaning of a negative skin test?

A negative skin test strongly suggests that the child has not been infected with TB bacilli. However the test may still be negative after a recent TB infection as it takes four to eight weeks to become positive.

### 3-8 What is the meaning of an intermediate skin test?

An intermediate result may be due to either BCG immunisation in the past two years or TB infection. In a healthy HIV-negative child this usually indicates that BCG has been given. The response to BCG becomes less with time. Unlike BCG, the skin test with tuberculosis does not fade as children get older.

Note
:	BCG could give a reactive Mantoux test within four to eight weeks of the immunisation. An area of induration of 5 to 9 mm may also indicate infection with a non-tuberculous Mycobacterium.

### 3-9 What is a significant Mantoux skin test in a child with HIV infection?

In HIV-infected or severely undernourished children, an intermediate Mantoux skin test (5–9 mm) indicates TB infection. Both malnutrition and HIV infection reduce the response to PPD.

### 3-10 What is the meaning of a positive skin test?
A positive skin test indicates that the child has been infected with TB bacilli. However it does not necessarily imply that the child has tuberculosis. Therefore a positive test cannot differentiate between TB infection and active tuberculosis. A positive skin test does not indicate that the child is immune to tuberculosis (i.e. does not mean that the child is protected against tuberculosis).

> A positive Mantoux skin test indicates tuberculous infection but not necessarily tuberculosis.

### 3-11 Does a negative Mantoux test exclude infection with tuberculous bacilli?

A negative skin test in a well-nourished child who is HIV negative usually means that the child has not been infected with TB bacilli and does not have tuberculosis. However the test may be negative in spite of active infection with TB bacilli if the child’s immune system cannot react to the tuberculin in the following situations:

*	In early tuberculous infection (the Mantoux skin test usually becomes positive only four to eight weeks after the TB infection)
*	Young infants
*	Children with severe malnutrition
*	HIV infection, especially if the CD4 count is low
*	After measles infection (for about six weeks)
*	Children with severe tuberculous disease
*	If the PPD is old or inactive due to incorrect storage
*	If poor technique was used in doing the Mantoux skin test

Therefore the Mantoux skin test may be negative even though the child has TB infection or tuberculosis (a false negative test).

> The Mantoux test may be negative in children with severe malnutrition, HIV infection, severe tuberculosis or soon after measles.

### 3-12 How should tuberculin be stored?

To obtain an accurate Mantoux test the PPD must be correctly stored and the intradermal injection must be given correctly. Failure of either may result in a negative test in a child with tuberculosis. The PPD must be stored away from light and heat as these will damage it. Freezing also damages PPD.

Therefore, PPD should be stored in a refrigerator between 2 and 8 °C (not in the freezer compartment) and kept in a cool bag while being transported. Once the vial has been opened, it should be kept cool and used within six hours as it is a live vaccine.

### 3-13 Are there other tests to identify sensitivity to TB bacilli?

There are a range of new blood tests which can accurately identify infection with TB bacilli. One day they may replace the tuberculin skin test. However, like the present skin tests, they indicate whether the child has TB infection only and not active tuberculosis. At present these tests are not yet recommended as standard care as they are expensive and their value in children living in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis and HIV is yet to be determined.

Note
:	These tests detect gamma interferon which is released by lymphocytes sensitised to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They can accurately distinguish between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and BCG.

## Identifying TB bacilli in sputum

### 3-14 How useful are sputum tests in diagnosing tuberculosis?

Sputum tests are very important as they are a way of identifying TB bacilli. If TB bacilli are identified in the sputum the child has pulmonary tuberculosis.

Identifying TB bacilli in sputum is a more accurate method than demonstrating sensitisation to TB bacilli (Mantoux skin test) when diagnosing tuberculosis.

> Finding TB bacilli in the sputum is a very important way of diagnosing tuberculosis.

### 3-15 Which are the commonly used sputum tests?

*	Sputum smear examination
*	Sputum culture of TB bacilli

TB bacilli in the sputum are usually identified by seeing the TB bacilli under a microscope or by growing (culturing) TB bacilli.

In addition, newer tests can identify TB bacilli by finding their DNA in the sputum.

> TB bacilli can be identified in sputum by smear examination or culture.

### 3-16 How is a specimen of sputum obtained for examination?

This is easy in an adult or older child who is asked to cough up a sample of sputum into a clean plastic container. It is essential that a sample of sputum and not saliva is obtained. Usually two samples of coughed up sputum on consecutive days are collected, at least one being collected early in the morning before brushing teeth or eating or drinking anything. The method is very successful if careful instruction is given on how to produce a sputum specimen. However, it is far more difficult in young children. Therefore other methods have to be used in younger children, especially children below six years of age who usually swallow their sputum:

*	Gastric aspirate
*	Saline-induced sputum

### 3-17 How is a sample of gastric aspirate obtained?

If a sputum sample cannot be coughed up by a child it is advised to collect a sample of gastric fluid which contains swallowed sputum. The gastric aspirate is best collected early in the morning before the first feed, the child having been nil per mouth for at least six hours. A nasogastric tube is passed through the infant’s nose and pushed down into the stomach. Once a sample of gastric aspirate is obtained, the tube is removed. This is an uncomfortable procedure for the child.

As gastric fluid is highly acid, 4% sodium bicarbonate in an equal volume to the gastric aspirate should be added to the specimen to neutralise the stomach acid. Otherwise the TB bacilli will be killed before they can be cultured. A sample of gastric aspirate should be collected on two consecutive mornings.

Note
:	Sodium hydroxide (preferably with N-acetyl-L-cysteine) can also be added to the sample of sputum to liquefy it and kill any contaminants. A mucolytic makes it easier to centrifuge the specimen, which concentrates any TB bacilli.

### 3-18 How can saline be used to improve the chance of collecting sputum?

The saline-induced method of obtaining sputum in young children is very useful when they are not able to cough up a sample themselves. This technique requires extra equipment and staff with special training. At present it is mostly used in tertiary-care hospitals but may in the future be used more widely.

It is important that a good sample of sputum is obtained to increase the chance that any TB bacilli will be detected.

Note
:	In a child who has had nothing to eat or drink for three hours, nebulised hypertonic saline is breathed in in order to mobilise sputum. The saline is an irritant that is used to induce a cough.

### 3-19 How rapidly should the sputum sample be sent to a laboratory for examination?

The sputum sample should be sent as quickly as possible to the nearest TB laboratory. It is best if the sputum smear is made within a few hours. The sooner the smear is made, the better the chance of seeing TB bacilli. The sputum container must be clearly marked and properly closed with the patient’s name and kept out of direct sunlight.

### 3-20 Do sputum samples always contain TB bacilli in children with pulmonary tuberculosis?

Young children usually cough up fewer TB bacilli than older children, adolescents and adults do. This is because they do not have ‘adult-type’ tuberculosis. Adults with tuberculosis usually have cavities in their lungs and cough up very large numbers of TB bacilli. Therefore they are very infectious and are said to have ‘open TB’. Sputum microscopy can identify the most infectious patients.

Note
:	Children with only a few TB bacilli in their sputum are said to have ‘paucibacillary TB’.

### 3-21 Is there a danger to the staff if they collect sputum samples?

Yes. It is therefore important that the staff are protected against inhaling TB bacilli when coughed-up sputum samples are collected. The room should be well ventilated and the staff should wear N95 respirators. Children can also wear masks to prevent the spread of small droplets which may contain TB bacilli. This is particularly important if the tuberculosis is resistant to first-line antibiotics. Although children spread fewer TB bacilli, they can still infect staff collecting sputum. Staff should wash their hands after collecting a sputum sample.

## Sputum smear examination

### 3-22 How useful is a sputum smear examination in diagnosing tuberculosis?

Examining a sputum smear under a microscope (sputum smear microscopy) is the easiest way of identifying TB bacilli and the oldest test used in identifying patients with tuberculosis.

> Smear sputum examination is an important method of proving tuberculosis.

### 3-23 How is a sputum smear examined for TB bacilli?

In order to see TB bacilli, a smear of the sputum is made on a glass slide. The smear is stained and then examined under a microscope. Two methods are used to stain and examine a sputum smear.

1.	The traditional method is to stain the smear with Ziehl-Neelsen stain and then look for TB bacilli under a light microscope. With this method the TB bacilli are first stained and then washed with acid. Unlike other types of bacteria, TB bacilli do not lose the stain when the slide is washed with acid. As a result the TB bacilli are called ‘acid-fast bacilli’ or ‘AFBs’. A result can be obtained in 20 minutes.
2.	A new method uses auramine-O stain before the smear is examined with a microscope using a blue light. The blue light makes the TB bacilli easy to see (they glow or fluoresce). This is a quicker and more accurate method. A result can be obtained in ten minutes.

Patients with a positive smear (TB bacilli are seen) are called ‘smear-positive’ patients. They are far more infectious than patients with tuberculosis who are ‘smear negative’. The more TB bacilli that are seen, the more infectious the patient is to others.

> Patients are called ‘smear positive’ if TB bacilli can be seen in their stained sputum.

Note
:	With the auramine-O method a blue light-emitting diode (LED) can be used instead of an expensive mercury vapour lamp. The accuracy of microscopy depends on the number of TB bacilli, the expertise of the examiner and the time spent looking for TB bacilli.

### 3-24 How reliable is a sputum smear examination in diagnosing tuberculosis?

Unfortunately it is not very reliable in children as many children with pulmonary tuberculosis have few TB bacilli in their sputum. It is a far more reliable test in adults. If the sputum smear examination is positive the child has pulmonary tuberculosis. However a negative smear does not rule out tuberculosis.

> Most children with pulmonary tuberculosis will have a negative sputum smear because they have very few bacilli in their sputum.

## Culture for TB bacilli

### 3-25 Can TB bacilli be cultured from children with tuberculosis?

Yes, TB bacilli can be cultured (grown), especially from children with pulmonary tuberculosis. However it is not possible to culture TB bacilli from all children with tuberculosis.

### 3-26 How is sputum collected for sputum culture?
The same sputum collection methods that are used for sputum 
smear examination are also used for sputum culture. It is important to keep the sputum specimen cool at 4–10 °C and get it to the TB laboratory as soon as possible.

### 3-27 How is sputum cultured?

Either a solid or liquid culture medium is used. It may take four to eight weeks to get a positive culture on solid medium although the growth of TB bacilli is faster at two to three weeks with a liquid (broth) medium. This long wait is the main problem with TB culture. However, an advantage is that drug sensitivity or resistance testing can be done if a positive culture is obtained.

Like sputum smear staining, sputum culture in children is not as sensitive as in adults, as there are usually are far fewer TB bacilli in the sputum.

### 3-28 Is sputum culture more sensitive than sputum smear examination?

Yes. Culture is far more accurate than sputum smear examination as it can detect far fewer TB bacilli. The culture may be positive when the smear is negative in a child or adult with tuberculosis. Therefore TB culture is important, especially if the smear is negative in a child with a history, clinical examination, Mantoux skin test and chest X-ray suggesting tuberculosis.

> Sputum culture is particularly useful in children with a negative smear.

### 3-29 Do all children with pulmonary tuberculosis have a positive sputum culture for TB bacilli?

Unfortunately, no. Due to the small number of TB bacilli in their sputum, many children with tuberculosis will have both a negative sputum smear and culture. Therefore the diagnosis of tuberculosis in children may have to be made on the history, clinical examination, chest X-ray and Mantoux test alone.

Note
:	In as many as 40% of children with tuberculosis, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed by sputum culture.

### 3-30 What new tests can be used to identify TB bacilli in sputum?

New rapid tests which identify TB bacilli in sputum samples or TB cultures are very exciting as they are sensitive and give quick and accurate results within 48 hours. At present they are expensive and require a specialised TB laboratory.

Note
:	New PCR-DNA rapid tests are very specific and can identify different species of Mycobacteria and detect drug resistance.

### 3-31 May TB bacilli be seen and cultured from other sites?

Yes. TB bacilli can be identified in CSF (cerebrospinal fluid), pleural effusions or ascites fluid. They may also be identified in fine needle aspirates of lymph nodes and in tissue biopsies. TB bacilli may also be seen in pus from an abscess or discharging ear.

## Chest X-ray

### 3-32 How useful is a chest X-ray in diagnosing tuberculosis?

A chest X-ray is one of the most important special investigations in diagnosing tuberculosis, especially in children with a negative sputum test. In these children it may be the only way of confirming a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.

> Chest X-ray is very important in diagnosing tuberculosis.

### 3-33 What chest X-ray views are needed?

It is important to get good quality frontal X-rays. A lateral view is useful but not essential.

### 3-34 What is the typical chest X-ray appearance in primary tuberculosis?

In pulmonary tuberculosis in children the most common finding on chest X-ray is hilar lymph node enlargement only.

### 3-35 What complications of primary tuberculosis can be seen on a chest X-ray?

*	Tuberculous pneumonia with areas of consolidation (opacification). This may be local or widespread.
*	TB with cavities (areas of breakdown)
*	Areas of lung collapse due to compression of large airways by the hilar lymph nodes
*	Pleural effusion
*	Miliary tuberculosis with tiny spots throughout both lungs

### 3-36 Are the chest X-ray findings easy to interpret in children with tuberculosis?

While the X-ray findings may be typical of tuberculosis, the diagnosis may be difficult. Tuberculosis may present with a wide range of appearances while other chest conditions may look like tuberculosis. The chest X-ray is often particularly difficult to interpret in children with HIV infection. Unlike acute bacterial or viral pneumonia, the chest X-ray findings do not rapidly disappear when treatment is started. Diagnosis should not be made on chest X-ray alone.

Sometimes a short trial of treatment for acute pneumonia with a drug such as amoxicillin, which is not effective for tuberculosis, may be used if the clinical diagnosis is uncertain. A failure to improve both clinically and on chest X-ray would support a diagnosis of tuberculosis.

## Fine needle aspiration of a lymph node

### 3-37 When is a fine needle aspiration indicated?

Enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) or inflamed or fluctuant lymph nodes in the neck are common in childhood tuberculosis. Aspiration with a thin needle is a very useful way of detecting TB bacilli. The TB bacilli can be identified on a smear examination or culture using the same methods as for sputum. The same tests can be done on pus from a discharging sinus.

### 3-38 How is a needle aspiration performed?

Aspiration is done with a 22 or 23 gauge needle. Instead of an aspiration, sometimes the whole node may be excised and examined for TB bacilli. It is important not to incise (cut into) the node as this may lead to sinus formation.

## Lumbar puncture

### 3-39 How is the clinical diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis confirmed?

If the symptoms and clinical signs suggest tuberculous meningitis, a lumbar puncture must be done to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for examination. Patients with tuberculous meningitis have a raised CSF protein and low glucose concentration with many white cells, especially lymphocytes. TB bacilli are seldom seen on a stained smear of CSF but may be cultured.

Note
:	Sometimes a lumbar puncture is contraindicated until after a computed tomography (CT) scan is done.

## Screening for HIV

### 3-40 Should all patients with suspected tuberculosis be screened for HIV?

Yes. This is important as many children with tuberculosis will also have HIV infection. Usually the HIV Rapid test can be used to screen children. However children under 18 months with a positive HIV Rapid test must also have a PCR test to confirm whether they are HIV infected (PCR positive) or only exposed to HIV with maternal antibodies (PCR negative).

Tuberculosis usually spreads more rapidly if the child is also HIV infected. Therefore it is important that all children with tuberculosis be screened for HIV infection. There are three important reasons to screen for HIV.

1.	The diagnosis of tuberculosis is more difficult in children with HIV infection. The Mantoux test may be negative while the clinical signs and chest X-ay appearance may be similar in tuberculosis and other HIV-related lung disease.
2.	All HIV-infected children treated for tuberculosis need to be referred for antiretroviral treatment.
3.	There are many drug interactions when children are treated for both tuberculosis and HIV. Therefore the medication, especially antiretroviral treatment, may require adjustment.

> All patients with suspected tuberculosis must be screened for HIV infection.

## Case study 1

A young child, whose mother has pulmonary tuberculosis, is brought to a clinic where the nurse performs a Mantoux skin test. BCG immunisation is recorded on the child’s Road-to-Health card. The mother is asked to bring the child back the following day so that the skin test can be read.

### 1. What is a Mantoux skin test?

Tuberculin (protein from dead TB bacilli) is injected into the skin. Later the site is examined for a reaction (an area of swelling).

### 2. When should the test be read?

48 to 72 hours (two to three days) after the test is done. It is too soon to read the test the following day as the skin reaction may not be fully developed yet.

### 3. How is the test read?

Using a ruler, the largest transverse (across the arm) diameter of the induration is read in millimetres.

### 4. What is a positive test?

An area of induration 10 mm or more. The area of redness is not important.

### 5. What does this result mean?

The child has TB infection. However a positive test cannot indicate whether the child also has tuberculosis.

### 6. Could the result be due to BCG immunisation?

No, as BCG usually gives an intermediate test result (i.e. 5 to 9 mm induration). A Mantoux skin test done a few years after BCG immunisation may be negative.

## Case study 2

A four-year-old child with suspected tuberculosis is referred to a TB clinic for sputum examination. It is also suggested that the child has a chest X-ray.

### 1. How should a sputum sample be obtained?

Unlike adults and older children, young children usually cannot cough up a sample of sputum. Therefore it has to be obtained by gastric aspirate or saline-induced collection.

### 2. What tests will be done on the sputum?

A smear examination and culture.

### 3. Does a negative smear exclude pulmonary tuberculosis?

No, as a negative smear is common in children with tuberculosis. However a positive smear will confirm a clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.

### 4. Is it worth asking for a culture if the smear is negative?

Yes, as the culture is more sensitive. Commonly in children the culture will be positive when the smear is negative. This is because there often are only a few TB bacilli in the sputum of children.

### 5. How long does it take to get a culture result?

Up to four weeks with liquid culture medium. New rapid tests will give a result in 48 hours, but only if the sputum smear is positive.

### 6. Is a chest X-ray also necessary?

Not if the sputum smear test is positive in older children. If the smear test is negative a chest X-ray is useful to confirm the diagnosis. The chest X-ray can be difficult to interpret in children with tuberculosis, especially if they are also infected with HIV.

## Case study 3

A young child with enlarged cervical nodes presents at a district hospital. The medical officer phones the referral hospital for advice on what investigations to do. There is a strong family history of tuberculosis.

### 1. What samples are required?

Obtain a sputum sample and a fine needle aspirate from an enlarged lymph node. The sputum sample will probably be collected by gastric aspirate.

### 2. What investigations are needed?

Smear examination and culture on both samples.

### 3. How should the gastric aspirate be prepared?

An equal volume of 4% sodium bicarbonate should be added to the gastric aspirate to neutralise the stomach acid. This will increase the chance of a positive culture. The sample should be kept cool and sent to the laboratory as soon as possible.

### 4. Is it not easier to simply take a chest X-ray?

In children it is difficult to diagnose tuberculosis on a chest X-ray alone. It is better to identify TB bacilli on sputum or some other sample such as a lymph node aspirate, pleural aspirate or cerebrospinal fluid. Many children with peripheral (cervical) lymphadenopathy have a normal chest X-ray.

### 5. What stains are used on a sputum smear?

Either a Ziehl-Neelsen or auramine-O stain.

### 6. Is it dangerous for health workers to collect a sputum sample?

It is possible to become infected with TB bacilli while collecting a coughed-up sputum sample. Therefore the health worker should wear a mask, choose a well-ventilated space and wash his or her hands well afterwards. This is particularly important in communities where drug-resistant tuberculosis is common.

## The five most important ‘take-home’ messages

1.	A positive Mantoux skin test indicates TB infection and not necessarily disease.
2.	A diagnosis of tuberculosis in a child depends on a history of exposure to tuberculosis, chronic symptoms of cough, a positive Mantoux skin test and typical chest X-ray findings. Not all have to be present to diagnose tuberculosis.
3.	Tuberculosis is confirmed by identifying or culturing TB bacilli in the sputum, gastric aspirate or other sample.
4.	A chest X-ray is important for diagnosing tuberculosis but not monitoring the response to treatment.
5.	HIV screening is essential in all children suspected of having tuberculosis.
