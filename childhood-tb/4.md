## Planning the management of a child with tuberculosis

### 4-1 What are the principles of managing children with tuberculosis?

*	Correct treatment
*	Good adherence
*	Careful follow up
*	Improved nutrition
*	Screening for HIV

### 4-2 Should all children with tuberculosis be treated in hospital?

Most children with uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis or tuberculous lymphadenopathy do not need admission to hospital. They can be treated at home and managed from a local clinic. Usually bed rest is not required.

Children with complicated tuberculosis (severe pulmonary or miliary tuberculosis or tuberculous meningitis) should be admitted to hospital.

## Treating tuberculosis

### 4-3 Can tuberculosis in children be cured?

Most cases of uncomplicated tuberculosis (more than 90%) can be cured with multiple drug treatment.

> Most patients with tuberculosis can be cured.

### 4-4 What are the aims of treating tuberculosis?

*	To cure the tuberculosis
*	To make the patient not infectious to others
*	To prevent relapse of tuberculosis
*	To prevent the development of drug resistance

### 4-5 How many drugs are used in the treatment of tuberculosis?

Tuberculosis is never treated with one drug alone. Usually three or four drugs are used together. One drug (usually INH) may be used in prophylaxis.

### 4-6 Why is more than one drug needed?

Multiple drugs are used as they are more effective than one drug only. This makes sure that tuberculosis is cured.

There is also less chance of drug resistance developing if multiple drugs are used. TB bacilli rapidly become resistant if only a single drug is used.

Note
:	Some drugs kill rapidly growing bacilli (bacteriocidal drugs) while others kill slow growing bacteria (sterilising drugs).

### 4-7 What is first-line treatment?

These are the drugs usually used to treat children who present with tuberculosis. They are the first choice as they are cheap, effective and have few side effects (adverse events). All adverse events from drugs should be reported to the local authority.

### 4-8 What drugs are used for first-line treatment?

The three commonly used first-line anti-tuberculous drugs in uncomplicated childhood tuberculosis are:

*	Isoniazid (INH)
*	Rifampicin
*	Pyrazinamide (PZA)

Other first-line drugs (ethambutol and streptomycin) have also been used. However they are less effective and have more serious adverse events. Streptomycin is no longer used in children.

> Commonly used first-line drugs to treat tuberculosis are isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide.

Note
:	Streptomycin was used in 1946 as the first anti-tuberculous drug.

### 4-9 How long is a course of first-line treatment?

For uncomplicated tuberculosis, the course of treatment usually lasts six months. This is divided into two phases.

1.	The intensive phase of two months
2.	The continuation phase of four months

All three drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide) are used for the intensive phase while only two drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin) are used during the continuation phase.

> Drug treatment for many months is needed to cure tuberculosis.

### 4-10 What is the aim of the intensive phase of treatment?

To rapidly kill as many TB bacilli as possible. To achieve this intensive treatment is needed with a number of drugs that have a high ability to kill TB bacilli. Rapidly reducing the number of TB bacilli stops the progression of the disease, makes patients less infectious and helps to prevent the development of drug resistance.

### 4-11 What is the aim of the continuation phase of treatment?

This longer phase of treatment is necessary to make sure that the remaining TB bacilli do not start to multiply once again. Fewer drugs are needed to achieve this.

### 4-12 What is short-course treatment?

This is the modern way of treating tuberculosis where a six-month course of drug treatment is used. Before rifampicin was developed, courses of 12 to 18 months were used. However compliance was often poor with these longer courses as many patients did not take their medication regularly or stopped treatment too soon. The cure rate of tuberculosis has improved with shorter, well-monitored courses of anti-tuberculous drugs. Short-course treatment is more cost effective but must be well managed.

### 4-13 How are drug doses calculated in children?

Usually body weight is used to calculate drug doses in children (i.e. mg/kg). When children respond to treatment and gain weight, the dose may need to be increased even though the dose per kg body weight remains the same.

### 4-14 How is isoniazid given?

Isoniazid (INH) is an excellent drug which is taken by mouth. It is cheap, has few adverse effects in children, and is particularly good at killing TB bacilli during the intensive phase. INH is given throughout the six-month course of treatment.

The dose of INH is 10 mg/kg/day. It is important not to use a smaller dose.

Note
:	Range is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day.

### 4-15 How is rifampicin given?

Rifampicin is also very good at killing TB bacilli and is used throughout the six-month course. It is given by mouth and has few adverse effects in children. Rifampicin colours the urine orange but this is harmless.

The dose of rifampicin is 15 mg/kg/day.

Note
:	Range in 10 to 20 mg/kg/day.

### 4-16 How is pyrazinamide given?

Pyrazinamide is used during the intensive phase to help kill dormant TB bacilli which are not multiplying. It is also taken by mouth.

The dose of pyrazinamide is 35 mg/kg/day.

Note
:	Ethambutol (20 mg/kg/day) is sometimes added to first-line treatment to help prevent the development of resistance to the other anti-tuberculous drugs in more extensive disease in children. The dosing range of ethambutol is 15 to 25 mg/kg/day.

### 4-17 How often are first-line drugs taken?

In South Africa INH, rifampicin and pyrazinamide are taken by mouth at the same time once a day, usually in the morning before breakfast.

Note
:	In some countries treatment is given in larger doses two or three times a week. Treatment twice a week is not recommended by WHO as one missed dose is a large part of the weekly treatment.

### 4-18 What are the adverse effects of first-line drugs?

Usually there are few serious adverse effects (side effects) with children. Adverse effects are more common in adults. The organ most commonly affected by first-line anti-TB drugs is the liver. All commonly used first-line drugs can cause hepatitis. There is no need to routinely measure liver enzymes. However liver enzymes must be measured in patients who are jaundiced and all anti-TB drugs should be stopped and patients referred for investigation and change of anti-TB treatment. If a child develops hepatitis on TB treatment other common causes of hepatitis must be looked for e.g. viral hepatitis A. Nausea and skin rashes may occur.

Note
:	INH may cause peripheral neuropathy, but this is very uncommon in children and routine pyridoxine supplementation is not needed. Hepatitis recovers once the drug causing the problem is stopped.

> Drugs used to treat tuberculosis can cause hepatitis.

### 4-19 What are the advantages of fixed-dose combination drugs?

First-line drugs are often given as fixed-dose combination drugs especially in older children. All three drugs are given as a single tablet (fixed-dose combination). This reduces the number of tablets that have to be taken and prevents children leaving out the drugs they do not like. As a result adherence is improved and the development of drug resistance reduced.

### 4-20 What is the management of complicated tuberculosis?

Children with severe pulmonary or miliary tuberculosis must be treated in hospital. Usually treatment is given for six to nine months and ethambutol is added as an extra drug to prevent the development of drug resistance.

In South Africa the treatment of tuberculous meningitis is for six months and ethionamide is used instead of ethambutol as it crosses well into the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid).

Children with complicated tuberculosis must be managed in hospital by doctors who have the required training and experience.

### 4-21 Why is streptomycin no longer used in children?

Streptomycin is not used in treating tuberculosis in children because:

*	It has to be given by injection which is painful.
*	Syringes and needles are expensive.
*	It can cause permanent nerve damage leading to deafness and difficulty with balance.
*	Dirty needles can spread HIV.

### 4-22 How does the treatment of children and adults differ?

Four drugs are used in adults during the initial phase of two months. Ethambutol is added to INH, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. This is because there are far more TB bacilli in tuberculosis with cavities which commonly occurs in adults. As children rarely have cavities, only three drugs are used in the initial phase. Just like in children, adults are usually treated with INH and rifampicin for the four-month continuation phase.

### 4-23 When should treatment be started?

When the diagnosis of tuberculosis is confirmed by identifying TB bacilli, usually in the sputum.

When the history, examination, skin test and chest X-ray strongly suggests tuberculosis even if the diagnosis cannot be confirmed by identifying TB bacilli. Some of these children are diagnosed after failing to respond to treatment for acute pneumonia. Therefore, some children are treated for tuberculosis without confirming the diagnosis on sputum examination.

> Drug treatment should be started if tuberculosis is proven or if there is a high clinical suspicion of disease.

## Good adherence

### 4-24 What is good adherence?

Excellent adherence (compliance) means that every dose of medication is taken each day at the correct time. If more than 80% of the doses are taken correctly, adherence is said to be good.

### 4-25 Why is good adherence important?

*	It greatly increases the chance for a cure.
*	It greatly reduces the risk of drug resistance developing.
*	It prevents the relapse (recurrence) of tuberculosis.

The most important aspect of treating a child with tuberculosis is to ensure that the medicine is taken correctly and regularly. This is often difficult as medication has to be taken for many months.

> Good adherence is essential to cure the patient and prevent drug resistance.

### 4-26 How can adherence be improved?

*	By the healthcare worker clearly explaining what tuberculosis is, and why treatment must be given for such a long time even if the child is clinically improving
*	By the healthcare worker giving clear instructions on when and how to take the medication
*	By a good understanding of these instructions by the child and parents
*	It is essential that the clinic staff establish a good relationship with mother and child.
*	With a written treatment plan
*	By supporting the family
*	By good follow up to check adherence
*	With a treatment diary to record medication taken
*	Using a daily pill box
*	Using ‘DOT’

### 4-27 What is DOT?

‘DOT’ stands for directly observed treatment. With DOT some responsible person in the community observes the child swallowing every dose of the anti-tuberculous drugs. In practice, this is usually done from Monday to Friday with the family making sure that the drugs are taken over weekends. The DOT worker (community trained treatment supporter) does not have to be a health professional and is usually not a family member. However the DOT support person must be reliable and trained for the task. They should be encouraging and make sure that the correct dose of each drug is taken. Unfortunately DOT is often not correctly implemented.

> With DOT a responsible person must see the child takes the tablets.

Note
:	In contrast to DOT, DOTS (directly observed treatment, short-course) is a strategy which has five elements: political commitment, sputum smear or culture diagnosis, regular supply of drugs, treatment supervision, and recording and reporting. DOT is only the supervision part.

### 4-28 What are the advantages of DOT?

DOT ensures good adherence without the child having to go to the clinic for every dose. If DOT is correctly used, the failure rate of treatment is greatly reduced and over 90% of children should be cured. The general public can play an important role in the control of TB by supporting DOT. DOT is a key factor in obtaining high cure rates and reducing the risk of drug resistance.

> The success of treatment depends on good support.

Note
:	The cure rate for TB without DOT in poor countries may be as low as 40%.

## Monitoring treatment

### 4-29 How is treatment monitored?

The child should be carefully followed up at the treatment clinic (ideally a clinic close to the family home). Each child must have a treatment sheet where each visit is recorded. The child’s clinical condition, weight, drugs taken and any identified problems must be noted. A careful record of the date of the next appointment must be made. If the child fails to attend on that date, the family must be contacted by phone or by a community health worker. It is important to be aware when a child misses a clinic appointment.

### 4-30 How is the response to treatment monitored?

Once the child has been on triple drug treatment for a few weeks the signs and symptoms should gradually improve and the child should start to feel well and gain weight. The most reliable feature of a good response to treatment is the disappearance of symptoms and weight gain.

After starting treatment the child should be seen every two weeks for the first month and then monthly for the rest of the treatment. The child should be weighed at every visit. As the child gains weight the drug dosages must be adjusted.

In older children with sputum smear-positive tuberculosis, a sputum sample for smear examination is collected at the end of the initial phase at two months. This should be negative for TB bacilli. Sputum samples are collected again after five months of treatment. If sputum smears or culture remain positive, drug susceptibility testing must be done to exclude drug resistance.

A definite improvement in the chest X-ray may be seen in early infections after a month. However, the X-ray changes may take months to improve. Therefore X-rays are not routinely used to determine if a child is responding to treatment.

### 4-31 What are the commonest causes of failure to cure tuberculosis?

*	Failure to take the medication correctly as prescribed (non-adherence). If doses of the drugs are missed repeatedly the tuberculosis will not be cured and drug resistance may develop.
*	If the treatment is stopped too soon the tuberculosis can return (relapse). In many poor countries it is common for patients with tuberculosis not to complete their full course of treatment. Once they feel well again they stop their medication. As a result, relapse of TB occurs, drug resistance develops and many people die of TB.
*	The child is HIV infected and is not receiving antiretroviral treatment. Response to anti-TB treatment is usually good in children with HIV infection.
*	Tuberculosis caused by multi-drug-resistant TB.

> Treatment of tuberculosis is difficult as it is lengthy and requires good adherence.

## Drug-resistant tuberculosis

### 4-32 What is drug-resistant tuberculosis?

This is tuberculosis where the TB bacilli are resistant to one or more of the first-line drugs.

Resistance to both INH and rifampicin is called multi-drug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. In multi-drug resistance, the TB bacilli continue to multiply and are not killed by the usual combination of first-line drugs.

Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis may develop because of incorrect treatment or poor adherence (acquired resistance). Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis can then be transmitted to close contacts (primary resistance). Both forms of multi-drug resistance are becoming a major problem in South Africa. Primary drug resistance is far more common than acquired resistance in children.

With extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, the TB bacilli are resistant to a wide range of anti-TB drugs including INH and rifampicin. This is extremely dangerous as most of these patients die. Like multi-drug resistance, extensively drug resistance may be primary or acquired.

Patients with multi-drug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis must be admitted to hospital for management with other expensive anti-TB drugs which often have more side effects.

> Drug resistance is becoming a major problem in South Africa.

Note
:	Patients with XDR TB are resistant to rifampicin and INH plus injectable second-line drugs (kanamycin, amikacin or capreomycin) as well as the fluoroquinolones (e.g. ofloxacin or moxifloxacin).

### 4-33 How is drug resistance diagnosed?

These patients fail to respond clinically to correct treatment with first-line drugs. This should always suggest drug resistance especially if there has been good adherence. It is very important to recognise drug resistance as soon as possible.

In children, drug-resistant tuberculosis should be suspected if they are in contact with an adult suffering from drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis.

Drug resistance can be diagnosed by one of two methods.

1.	In the first method TB bacilli are cultured and then tested against the anti-TB drugs (INH and rifampicin). Using this method takes weeks to months to get a result.
2.	In the second method drug resistance can be proved by rapid tests which identify the abnormalities in the DNA of TB bacilli which are know to be associated with drug resistance. Resistance to INH and rifampicin are usually determined. These new rapid tests can be done on a sputum sample or culture and the results are available in a few days. This method is being introduced in South Africa.

> Drug-resistant tuberculosis should be suspected when children with good adherence fail to improve clinically or have been in contact with a multi-drug-resistant patient.

### 4-34 What are the causes of acquired drug resistance?

These patients do not have drug resistance when antituberculous treatment is started. It develops during the course of treatment because of failure of good adherence due to:

*	Inadequate patient education on the importance of good adherence
*	Failure to understand the importance of completing the full course of treatment even if the patient is feeling much better
*	Poor support (failed DOT)
*	Inadequate supply of drugs (no drugs available at the clinic)
*	Side effects leading to poor adherence or stopping one drug
*	Poor follow up of patients on treatment

These factors are all related to the inadequate care of patients with tuberculosis. Therefore, poor management of tuberculosis in the community is the main cause of drug resistance.

> Drug resistance is caused by poor tuberculosis management.

### 4-35 How are patients with drug resistance managed?

They must be managed by special TB units with doctors who are experienced in caring for these patients.

## Good nutrition

### 4-36 Why is good nutrition important in children with tuberculosis?

*	Because malnutrition and tuberculosis go ‘hand in hand’, most children with tuberculosis are underweight.
*	Malnourished children with an inadequate diet have a weakened immune system and are at high risk of developing tuberculosis.
*	Tuberculosis leads to poor appetite, failure to thrive and weight loss which results in malnutrition.
*	Poverty and overcrowding are common factors in both malnutrition and tuberculosis.

It is therefore important to improve the nutrition of all children to help protect them against tuberculosis, and improve the nutrition in children with tuberculosis.

> Malnutrition and tuberculosis are often found together.

### 4-37 How can the nutrition of children be assessed?

Weighing is the best method of screening children for malnutrition. All children with a weight below the normal range for their age are at high risk of malnutrition.

The weight of children with tuberculosis must be regularly recorded and plotted on a weight-for-age chart. The Road-to-Health card should be used in children under five years of age. Gaining weight is an important sign that the child is responding to anti-tuberculous treatment.

> Plotting weight is an important way of assessing a child’s response to treatment.

### 4-38 How can nutrition be improved?

By improving the child’s diet. Sugar or vegetable oil will add energy to a meal while milk powder or beans will add protein.

All children with tuberculosis should receive 200 000 units of vitamin A once by mouth as well as a daily multivitamin supplement.

Once the appetite returns the amount of food eaten each day will need to be increased. Financial assistance (e.g. child support grants) or food parcels may be needed.

## Treating tuberculosis and HIV co-infection

### 4-39 What is the relation between tuberculosis and HIV infection?

Often both TB and HIV infections occur together. The risk of getting tuberculosis is many times higher in children who are HIV infected, especially if they are not on antiretroviral treatment.

Tuberculosis is more severe in children with an immune system weakened by HIV infection. Children with HIV infection are also more likely to develop tuberculosis if they are infected with TB bacilli.

In turn, tuberculosis speeds up the progress from asymptomatic HIV infection to severe clinical disease.

Therefore, all children presenting with tuberculosis must have provider-initiated HIV screening.

### 4-40 How may HIV infection interfere with the drug treatment of tuberculosis?

There may be an interaction between the drugs used to treat tuberculosis and the drugs used to treat HIV infection. Adherence may also be poor as a greater number of drugs have to be taken while the risk of side effects to some of the anti-TB and antiretroviral drugs increases.

Rifampicin lowers the blood levels of some antiretroviral drugs especially nevirapine and the protease inhibitors.

When children with tuberculosis also have HIV infection, both infections must be treated. This should be managed at a clinic with the experience and expertise to treat children with TB/HIV co-infection.

### 4-41 What is immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)?

This is the unexpected clinical deterioration in a patient who was improving on anti-TB and antiretroviral treatment. IRIS presents a few weeks after antiretroviral treatment is started. As the immune system starts to recover the body may have an inflammatory reaction to the TB bacilli resulting in IRIS.

The two most common symptoms of IRIS are unexplained fever and enlarging lymph nodes. These children need to be referred to facilities with experience in managing TB/HIV co-infected children as the diagnosis can be difficult and other causes of deterioration such as drug resistance need to be excluded.

IRIS due to previous BCG immunisation may also occur once antiretroviral treatment is started in infants.

## Case study 1

A boy of six years old is diagnosed with uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis and is followed up at a district hospital. His parents are told he will need to take medication every day for six months. They are worried that tuberculosis cannot be cured.

### 1. Can uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis be cured?

There is an excellent chance that he will be cured provided that adherence to treatment is good.

### 2. What drugs should be used to treat this boy?

He should receive first-line treatment of rifampicin, INH and pyrazinamide for two months followed by rifampicin and INH only for another four months. This is known as short-course treatment. The first two months of treatment is called the intensive phase while the last four months are called the continuation phase.

### 3. Why is he not treated with rifampicin alone?

Because TB bacilli become resistant to treatment if only a single drug is used. That is why either two or three drugs are always used together as multiple-drug treatment.

### 4. How often should the drugs be taken?

It is best if the drugs are taken once every day of the week, usually at breakfast.

### 5. Are side effects to the drugs common?

Children usually have no, or only mild, side effects to the first-line drugs used to treat tuberculosis.

### 6. How are the doses of the drugs calculated?

The child’s body weight is used to calculate the daily dose. As the child improves and gains weight, the daily dose may have to be increased.

## Case study 2

A seven-month-old child is admitted to hospital with tuberculous meningitis. One of the older children in the family is also found to have tuberculosis. The mother asks whether the infant can be treated at home as it is a long way to the hospital.

### 1. What drugs are used to treat tuberculous meningitis?

The standard first-line drugs plus ethionamide. This drug is chosen as it crosses the blood brain barrier well. Treatment is given for six to nine months.

### 2. What other anti-TB drug is added for severe pulmonary or miliary tuberculosis?

Ethambutol.

### 3. Is streptomycin also used in children with complicated tuberculosis?

No, as it is a painful injection which has to be given daily and has serious side effects. The needles and syringes are expensive and can spread HIV if they are reused.

### 4. Should treatment be started if a definite diagnosis of tuberculosis cannot be made?

If there is a strong clinical suspicion of tuberculosis but TB bacilli cannot be identified, for example in the sputum, treatment should be started.

### 5. Can this infant with tuberculous meningitis be treated at home?

While the child remains clinically ill treatment must be given in hospital. If discharged home, it is essential that treatment is strictly supervised as a break in treatment may result in death or serious neurological damage.

### 6. What other infection must always be screened for in children with tuberculosis?

HIV.

## Case study 3

An adolescent with pulmonary tuberculosis is referred to hospital because she has not improved after six weeks of treatment. The home conditions are poor and she admits that she often does not take her medication. Her family is always fighting and is not interested in helping her with her treatment.

### 1. Why is she failing to respond to treatment?

Poor adherence. Not taking medication regularly every day is a common cause of treatment failure. Lack of family support is a serious problem when treating childhood illnesses such as tuberculosis.

### 2. How can this problem be corrected?

By using DOT (directly observed treatment). A treatment supporter must support her taking her medication each day while the importance of good adherence must be explained to her. Trained members from the community can become DOT supporters.

### 3. What other steps can be taken to improve adherence?

A written treatment plan, treatment diary and pill box should help to improve adherence. Support from the clinic staff is also very important.

### 4. What other problem may result from poor adherence?

Drug resistance to the medication used for first-line treatment.

### 5. What is multi-drug resistance?

Resistance to both rifampicin and INH. This is becoming a major problem in South Africa.

## The six most important ‘take-home’ messages

1.	Uncomplicated tuberculosis in children is treated with three first-line drugs.
2.	Good adherence is essential to cure tuberculosis.
3.	Good appetite and weight gain are early indicators of response to treatment
4.	Good nutrition is an important part of managing children with tuberculosis.
5.	Poor response to treatment in spite of good adherence suggests multi-drug resistance.
6.	Suspect drug resistance if the child has been in contact with an adult suffering from drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis.
