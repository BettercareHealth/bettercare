# Test 5: Management of patients on anti­retroviral treatment

1.	When should prophylactic co-trimoxazole be stopped?
	-	When antiretroviral treatment is started
	-	When the patient starts to feel better
	+	When the CD4 count has risen above 200 cells/µl
	-	When the patient has been on antiretroviral treatment for a year
2.	When should the routine follow-up visits be done during the first four months after starting antiretroviral treatment?
	-	Weekly
	-	Every two weeks
	+	Monthly (four, eight and 12 weeks)
	-	At six and 12 weeks
3.	When should education and counselling be provided?
	-	During the preparation of antiretroviral treatment only
	-	At the first treatment visit only
	-	During the first three months of antiretroviral treatment only
	+	At every visit
4.	Who are the members of the multi­disciplinary team at the antiretroviral clinic?
	-	The doctors
	-	Both the doctors and the nurses
	+	All the staff
	-	Both the staff and patients
5.	What should be done at each follow up visit?
	+	The patient should be weighed.
	-	The CD4 count should be measured.
	-	The viral load should be measured.
	-	The serum ALT (alanine aminotransferase) should be measured.
6.	How often should medicines be collected from the clinic?
	-	Every week
	+	Every one to three months
	-	Every four to five months
	-	Every six months
7.	A haemoglobin (Hb) level and differential count at months 3 and 6 should be measured in patients receiving:
	-	Nevirapine
	-	d4T
	-	3TC
	+	AZT
8.	What monitoring for side effects is needed for TDF?
	+	Creatine clearance monitoring
	-	Full blood count
	-	Fasting serum cholesterol and triglyceride
	-	Serum ALT (alanine aminotransferase)
9.	How often should a patient be seen by the doctor or nurse if antiretroviral treatment is successful?
	-	Every month
	+	Every three months
	-	Every six months
	-	Every year
10.	For how long can treatment be successful?
	-	Usually for a year
	-	From one to five years
	-	From five to 10 years
	+	More than 10 years
11.	What indicates treatment failure?
	-	The development of immune reconstruction inflammatory syndrome
	-	A CD4 count above 200 cells/µl
	-	An undetectable viral load
	+	A viral load above 1000 copies/ml
12.	What should be done if the second-line of treatment fails in spite of excellent adherence?
	+	Refer the patient for resistance testing
	-	Change back to the first-line treatment
	-	Use both first- and second-line treatment together
	-	Add rifampicin and co-trimoxazole
13.	What are the dangers of poor adherence?
	+	Treatment failure
	-	Serious side effects
	-	Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
	-	It will upset the clinic staff
14.	How can adherence be improved?
	-	By taking both the morning and evening medication at lunch time
	-	By taking medication three times a week
	+	By setting an alarm clock as a reminder
	-	By collecting the medication from the clinic each day
15.	How can antiretroviral drug resistance be avoided?
	-	Use monotherapy (one drug only)
	-	Use two drugs together from the same class
	+	Take a combination of at least three drugs from two classes
	-	Take at least 60% of all doses
16.	What is the commonest cause of treatment failure?
	+	Poor adherence 
	-	Pregnancy
	-	Taking antiretroviral drugs with meals
	-	Viral ‘blips’
17.	Rifampicin markedly reduces the blood levels of:
	-	‘Nucs’ such as AZT
	-	‘Non-nucs’ such as efavirenz
	+	‘PIs’ such as Aluvia
	-	All antiretroviral drugs
18.	What should be done if a patient has a severe drug reaction to an antiretroviral drug?
	-	Stop that drug.
	+	Stop all antiretroviral drugs.
	-	Continue the treatment but give steroids such as intravenous prednisone.
	-	Continue the treatment but give an oral antihistamine.
19.	Which patients are at the greatest risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome?
	-	Patients who are generally well when the antiretroviral treatment is started
	-	Patients with a low viral load
	+	Patients with a very low CD4 count
	-	Patients who are younger than 20 years old
20.	Which HIV-associated infection is commonest with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in South Africa?
	-	Cryptococcal meningitis
	-	Cytomegalovirus retinitis
	-	Leprosy
	+	Tuberculosis
