# Bettercare legacy repository

This repository is now only a history of the first few years of development of Bettercare learning programmes in the early Electric Book workflow. The history is contained in the `gh-pages` branch.

Everything else in this repo, is now deprecated. Do not use it, especially because any medical advice here may be dangerously out of date.

New, updated content is available at [github.com/bettercareHealth/learn](http://github.com/bettercareHealth/learn).
