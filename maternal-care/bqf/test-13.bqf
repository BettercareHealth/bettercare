title: Maternal Care. Test 13. Medical problems during pregnancy and the puerperium

A patient with cystitis usually complains of:
-	Headache
-	Fever and rigors
+	Dysuria and frequency
-	Backache

Cystitis is treated by:
-	Asking the patient to increase her oral fluid intake
+	Prescribing a single oral dose of amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole
-	Giving 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin intramuscularly
-	Giving ampicillin 1 g intravenously every 6 hours until the symptoms stop

A patient with asymptomatic bacteriuria has:
+	No symptoms
-	Fever
-	Nocturia
-	Lower abdominal pain

It is important to treat patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy because:
-	The patient is seriously ill
-	One third will develop septic shock during pregnancy
-	One third will develop cystitis during pregnancy
+	One third will develop acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy

How is asymptomatic bacteriuria diagnosed?
-	By detecting proteinuria
-	By testing for nitrites and leucocytes in the urine
-	By examining a sample of urine under the microscope
+	By culturing a sample of midstream urine

Which clinical sign suggests that the patient has acute pyelonephritis?
-	Tenderness over the bladder
-	Oedema
+	Severe tenderness to percussion over one or both renal angles
-	Severe tenderness in the upper abdomen

What is the correct management of a patient with acute pyelonephritis?
-	Amoxicillin (Amoxil) 3 g as a single oral dose
-	Amoxicillin (Amoxil) 500 mg 8-hourly by mouth for seven days as an outpatient
-	The patient must be admitted to hospital and receive amoxicillin (Amoxil) 500 mg 8-hourly by mouth for seven days
+	The patient must be admitted to hospital and receive an intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic

What is the definition of anaemia in pregnancy?
-	A haemoglobin concentration of less than 12 g/dl
+	A haemoglobin concentration of less than 11 g/dl
-	A haemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dl
-	Any patient with shortness of breath irrespective of the haemoglobin concentration

What is the commonest cause of anaemia in pregnancy?
+	Iron deficiency
-	Folic acid deficiency
-	Infection
-	Blood loss

The management of anaemia in pregnancy depends on:
-	The presence or absence of oedema
-	Whether the patient is pale or not
+	The presence or absence of shortness of breath and tachycardia
-	The presence or absence of hypotension

What should be the management of an anaemic patient if the haemoglobin concentration is less than 8 g/dl and the gestational age 37 weeks?
-	Admit to hospital for bed rest and a good diet
+	Admit to hospital for a blood transfusion
-	Give an intramuscular injection of iron-dextran (Imferon)
-	Prescribe 1 ferrous sulphate tablet 3 times a day until delivery

What should be the management of a patient in the puerperium who has normal observations and has no bleeding, but has a haemoglobin concentration of 9 g/dl?
-	Reassure her that no treatment is needed.
-	Give her a blood transfusion.
-	Advise her to eat a good diet.
+	Prescribe an oral iron supplement.

Which patients should receive supplementary iron during pregnancy?
-	All patients
-	Only patients with a haemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dl
-	Only patients with a full blood count suggesting iron deficiency
+	Patients from communities where iron deficiency is common or socio-economic circumstances are poor

What should be done if a patient has side effects from the iron supplementation?
-	She should be reassured and the importance of taking the iron tablets should be stressed.
+	The tablets should be taken with meals.
-	The iron tablets should be stopped.
-	The iron tablets should be stopped and metoclopramide (Maxalon) given.

A patient with asymptomatic heart valve disease:
-	Must be admitted to hospital for bed rest from 34 weeks gestation
+	Must be delivered in hospital because of the high risk of pulmonary oedema during labour and the first day of the puerperium
-	Should be classified as low risk and delivered in a primary perinatal-care clinic
-	Should be given Syntometrine after delivery to prevent a postpartum haemorrhage

A patient with heart valve disease should:
+	Be nursed on her side during labour with her body raised with pillows to 45 degrees
-	Be nursed on her side during labour with her body flat on the bed
-	Be delivered in the lithotomy position
-	Be heavily sedated during labour

Which complication is common if diabetes is not well controlled in the third trimester?
-	Anaemia
+	Pre-eclampsia
-	Oligohydramnios
-	Pulmonary oedema

Which complication is common in the second stage of labour in patients with poorly controlled diabetes?
-	Precipitous (sudden, unexpected) delivery
+	Impacted shoulders
-	Hypoglycaemia
-	Hyperglycaemia

A random blood glucose concentration should be done when:
-	1+ ketonuria is detected for the first time in pregnancy.
+	1+ glucosuria is detected for the first time in pregnancy.
-	Patients attend their first antenatal care clinic.
-	Patients attend their second antenatal care clinic.

Which random blood glucose concentration is normal?
-	Less than 4 mmol/l
-	Less than 6 mmol/l
+	Less than 8 mmol/l
-	Less than 11 mmol/l
