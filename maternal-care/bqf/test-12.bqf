title: Maternal Care. Test 12. The puerperium

The puerperium starts:
-	When the infant is delivered
+	When the placenta is delivered
-	One hour after delivery of the infant
-	24 hours after delivery of the placenta

Soon after a normal delivery a healthy patient’s pulse rate should be:
-	Below 80 beats per minute
+	Below 100 beats per minute
-	Below 120 beats per minute
-	Above 100 beats per minute

In the puerperium stress incontinence:
+	Is common
-	Is uncommon
-	Requires referral to the doctor
-	Is a sign of a urinary tract infection

In the puerperium the haemoglobin concentration becomes stable by:
-	6 weeks
-	Day 7
+	Day 4
-	Day 1

In a normal puerperium the cervical os should be closed by:
-	Day 3
+	Day 7
-	Day 14
-	6 weeks

Normal lochia:
-	Is colourless
-	Has no smell
-	Has an offensive smell
+	Has a non-offensive smell

On day seven postpartum the size of a normally involuting uterus should correspond to a gestational age of approximately:
-	8 weeks
+	12 weeks
-	16 weeks
-	20 weeks

A normally involuting uterus will be:
-	Soft and tender
-	Soft and not tender
-	Firm and tender
+	Firm and not tender

Which of the following statements is the most important one when considering the first hour following delivery of the placenta?
-	The blood pressure and pulse rate must be determined every 15 minutes.
-	The haemoglobin concentration must be estimated.
-	The patient must pass urine during this period.
+	Ensure continuously that the uterus is well contracted.

To prevent a postpartum haemorrhage after delivery of the placenta:
+	The patient must be shown how to rub up the uterus.
-	An intravenous infusion should be started before every delivery.
-	An intravenous infusion with 20 units of oxytocin should be put up after delivery of the placenta.
-	The haemoglobin concentration must be estimated every 2 hours for the first 12 hours after delivery.

How frequently should a primipara visit the clinic for postpartum care in the puerperium?
-	At least daily for seven days
-	At least daily for 5 days and again on day seven
+	At least on days 1, 3, 5 and seven
-	The patient must be kept in hospital for at least 5 days.

A patient has puerperal pyrexia if her temperature:
-	Rises to 37.3 °C and is maintained for 24 hours during the first 10 days postpartum
-	Rises to 38 °C or higher and is maintained for 24 hours during the first 10 days postpartum
-	Rises to 37.5 °C on two occasions during the first 10 days postpartum
+	Rises to 38 °C or higher during the puerperium

Which of the following indicate that puerperal pyrexia is caused by a genital tract infection?
-	General malaise
-	Rigors
+	Offensive lochia
-	A marked tachycardia

How must a patient with a urinary tract infection causing puerperal pyrexia be treated?
+	Admission to hospital for intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics
-	Admission to hospital, tepid sponging and paracetamol to bring down the temperature
-	Oral broad-spectrum antibiotics given to the patient at home
-	Oral broad-spectrum antibiotics and paracetamol given to the patient at home

If a patient presents with puerperal pyrexia, it would be most important to:
-	Hospitalise the patient and start her on ampicillin and metronidazole (Flagyl).
-	Treat the patient with ampicillin and metronidazole (Flagyl) at home.
-	Hospitalise the patient and immediately start with tepid sponging and paracetamol to bring down the temperature.
+	Find the cause of the pyrexia and start the appropriate treatment.

A patient who develops the ‘puerperal blues’ needs to be:
-	Referred to a psychiatrist
-	Isolated together with her infant
+	Comforted and given an explanation of her feelings
-	Treated with a benzodiazepine (e.g. Ativan)

What is a secondary postpartum haemorrhage?
-	Any vaginal bleeding that appears excessive, after the first hour following delivery of the placenta
+	Any vaginal bleeding that appears excessive, after the first 24 hours following delivery of the placenta
-	Any vaginal bleeding that appears excessive, between the fifth and 15th day of the puerperium
-	Any vaginal bleeding in the puerperium which is severe enough to cause the patient to become shocked

What is the most common cause of a secondary postpartum haemorrhage?
+	Intra-uterine infection with or without a retained piece of placenta
-	An infected slough of the cervix or vagina
-	Breakdown of a Caesarean section scar
-	Gestational trophoblastic disease

The treatment of a patient with a secondary postpartum haemorrhage will include:
-	Ampicillin and metronidazole (Flagyl)
-	Syntometrine and/or oxytocin
-	Removal of retained products of conception under general anaesthesia
+	All of the above

Observations of the presence or absence of offensive lochia in the patient or jaundice in her infant in the puerperium:
+	Can be made by the patient as well as the midwife
-	Should not be expected from patients as they are too unreliable
-	Should only be made by a midwife or doctor
-	Should only be made by a doctor
