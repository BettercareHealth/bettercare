title: Maternal Care. Test 4. Antepartum haemorrhage

What is the definition of an antepartum haemorrhage?
-	Any vaginal haemorrhage between conception and delivery
-	Any vaginal haemorrhage during labour
+	Any vaginal haemorrhage between 24 weeks gestation and delivery
-	Any vaginal haemorrhage between 24 weeks and the onset of labour

Antepartum haemorrhage is an important complication of pregnancy because:
-	It is a common cause of iron-deficiency anaemia.
-	The fetus may become anaemic.
-	It may be due to cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia.
+	Both the mother and fetus may die.

Which of the following is an important sign of shock due to blood loss?
+	A fast pulse rate
-	A low haemoglobin concentration
-	Concentrated urine
-	Pyrexia

Why is a speculum examination done on a patient with an antepartum haemorrhage?
-	To see how dilated the cervix is
-	To exclude a placenta praevia before a digital examination is done
+	To exclude a local cause of the bleeding from the vagina or cervix
-	To look for a blood clot in the vagina

An antepartum haemorrhage with no fetal heart heard is usually caused by:
-	Placenta praevia
+	Abruptio placentae
-	Antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause
-	Trichomonal vaginitis

What is the most likely cause of a massive antepartum haemorrhage that threatens the mother’s life?
-	Abruptio placentae
-	Rupture of the uterus
-	Cervical carcinoma
+	Placenta praevia

Which of the following factors will place a patient at the highest risk of abruptio placentae? 
+	A history of abruptio placentae in a previous pregnancy.
-	Any of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
-	Intra-uterine growth retardation.
-	Cigarette smoking.

Which of the following would suggest an abruptio placentae?
+	The uterus is tonically contracted and tender.
-	Fetal movements are usually present.
-	The haemoglobin concentration is low.
-	The uterus is relaxed and the fetal parts are easily felt.

Which management would be correct if abruptio placentae with an intra-uterine death was diagnosed?
-	The fetus must be delivered by Caesarean section.
-	A vaginal examination must not be done because the patient has had an antepartum haemorrhage.
+	A vaginal examination must be done to rupture the membranes and, thereby, obtain a vaginal delivery.
-	The spontaneous onset of labour must be awaited.

Which of the following patients is at an increased risk of placenta praevia?
-	A patient with one of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
+	A patient with a multiple pregnancy
-	A patient with intra-uterine growth retardation
-	A patient who smokes

Vaginal bleeding due to placenta praevia is usually associated with:
-	Fetal parts that are difficult to feel and an absent fetal heartbeat
-	Engagement of the fetal head
+	A uterus that is relaxed and not tender on palpation
-	Lower abdominal pain

In which of the following patients can placenta praevia be excluded?
-	A patient with a slight vaginal bleed
+	When 2/5 or less of the fetal head can be palpated above the pelvic brim on abdominal examination
-	A patient with a painless, bright red vaginal bleed
-	A patient with a breech presentation

Which of the following will exclude a placenta praevia?
-	A careful speculum examination
-	A careful abdominal examination
-	The presence of fetal distress
+	Ultrasonography

14.	Following a small vaginal bleed at 34 weeks gestation, the diagnosis of placenta praevia is confirmed with ultrasonography. Which of the following will be the correct further management?
-	The fetus must be delivered immediately by Caesarean section.
-	A vaginal examination must be done in theatre immediately to confirm the diagnosis.
+	The patient must be hospitalised and managed conservatively until 36 weeks or until active bleeding starts again.
-	The membranes must be ruptured to induce labour.

An antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause should be suspected:
-	When the history and abdominal examination are not suggestive of an abruptio placentae
-	When local causes of bleeding have been excluded by a speculum examination
-	When a placenta praevia is excluded
+	When all of the above causes of an antepartum haemorrhage have been excluded

How should you manage a patient with an antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause?
+	The patient must be admitted to hospital where fetal movements should be carefully monitored, especially during the first 24 hours.
-	Because the risk of an abruptio placentae is so great, an emergency Caesarean section must be done.
-	Once the diagnosis is made, the patient should be discharged and followed up as a low-risk patient.
-	The patient must be hospitalised until 38 weeks of gestation, when labour should be induced.

An antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause should always be regarded as a serious complication of pregnancy because:
-	Intra-uterine growth restriction is often present.
-	It may be caused by cervical cancer.
+	Abruptio placentae may be present.
-	Placenta praevia may be present.

Which of the following is typical of a ‘show’?
-	A vaginal bleed that soaks a sanitary towel
+	A slight bleed consisting of blood mixed with mucus
-	A vaginal discharge mixed with blood
-	Contact bleeding from the cervix caused by a speculum examination

If a speculum examination is done on a patient with a history suggestive of a blood-stained discharge, what finding would diagnose an antepartum haemorrhage?
-	Bleeding from a closed cervical os
-	A blood-stained discharge seen in the vagina
-	Contact bleeding when the speculum touches the cervix
+	Bulging membranes through a partially dilated cervix

How should you manage a patient who presents at 30 weeks of gestation with a blood-stained vaginal discharge which is caused by vaginitis?
-	The urine should be tested with a reagent strip for protein, nitrites and leucocytes.
-	A cytology smear must be taken from the cervix to identify the organism causing the vaginitis.
-	A vaginal examination should be done in theatre as with any other patient who presents with an antepartum haemorrhage.
+	The patient and her partner must be treated with metronidazole (Flagyl).
