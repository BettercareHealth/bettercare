title: Maternal Care. Test 15. Regionalised perinatal care

What is regionalised perinatal care?
-	All perinatal care in a town is provided in a single hospital.
-	All patients living in a community are delivered at the same clinic.
+	All perinatal care in a region is controlled by a single health authority.
-	The community must provide the money needed to run the clinics in that region.

What percentage of patients can usually be classified as low risk?
-	10%
-	20%
+	35%
-	60%

Most low-risk pregnant women should be:
-	Delivered in hospital
+	Delivered in a perinatal-care clinic
-	Delivered by a doctor
-	Delivered at home

A regional hospital which provides tertiary (specialist) care is also referred to as a:
-	Level 4 hospital
+	Level 3 hospital
-	Level 2 hospital
-	Level 1 hospital

How can a regional hospital assist the district hospital in that region?
-	By instructing the clinic to refer all patients with clinical problems directly to the regional hospital
-	By encouraging district hospitals to provide specialist care
-	By insisting that the district hospital care for all their own patients with clinical problems and, thereby, make the district hospital independent
+	By providing educational programmes for the staff in district hospitals

A district hospital can assist the perinatal-care clinic in that area by:
-	Sending doctors to care for the patients at the clinic
+	Providing the clinic staff with advice when asked
-	Reporting to the hospital superintendent any management errors made at a clinic
-	Offering to deliver 50% of their low-risk patients

How can the staff at a perinatal-care clinic improve communications with the referral hospital?
+	By writing good notes
-	By drawing up their own list of referral criteria
-	By making their own transport arrangements
-	By demanding that doctors from the district hospital assist with the antenatal-care clinics

A perinatal-care clinic is:
-	A clinic which provides antenatal care only
-	A clinic which provides both antenatal and postnatal care
+	A clinic which provides care during delivery as well as during the antenatal period and the puerperium
-	A clinic which provides care to women before, during, and after delivery, as well as to the infant during the first year of life

The midwife at a perinatal-care clinic should:
-	Only deliver patients if a doctor is present
+	Function as an independent nurse-practitioner (i.e. be responsible for all the clinical care given)
-	Only provide antenatal care
-	Only work in the clinic and not spend part of the year working in the referral hospital

A perinatal-care clinic should:
-	Always be close to a district hospital.
-	Be separate from a centre which provides primary healthcare.
+	Be acceptable to the local community.
-	Only be available in rural areas.

What is the role of the community in the management of a perinatal clinic?
-	The community should appoint the staff at the clinic.
-	The community should have no role in the management of the clinic.
+	The community should become involved with the running of the clinic.
-	The midwives should all come from the local community.

It is safer to deliver a patient at a perinatal-care clinic than at home because:
-	A doctor is always available at the clinic.
+	The clinic has the staff and facilities to manage most clinical problems.
-	Infection is commoner after a home delivery.
-	Postpartum haemorrhage cannot be prevented at a home delivery.

The referral criteria for each clinic:
-	Should be decided by the clinic staff and the community
-	Should be decided by the hospital staff
-	Should be decided by the doctor in charge
+	Should be decided by the senior medical and nursing staff at both the clinic and hospital

When clinic staff speak to a patient they should:
-	Not allow the patient to ask questions
-	Give her a detailed report on any clinical problem which has developed
+	Use simple language
-	Call her ‘Mommy’ as this shows that they are interested in her pregnancy

Patient notes at a perinatal-care clinic should:
-	Be kept by the clinic
-	Be written in the patient’s folder
+	Be recorded in a maternity case record which the patient keeps
-	Be written in detail both in the clinic folder and on the patient’s materity case record.

What should be done to make the transfer of a patient from a clinic to hospital as safe as possible?
-	She should be transferred immediately.
-	Time should not be wasted by contacting the hospital by telephone.
+	The patient should be stabilised before transfer.
-	The patient should only be transferred when a doctor is available to accompany her.

What is an important danger to a woman during urgent transfer for hypertension in pregnancy from a clinic to a hospital?
+	Eclampsia
-	Dehydration
-	Postural hypotension
-	Motor vehicle accident

How is the maternal mortality ratio expressed?
-	As a percentage
-	Per 1000 deliveries
-	Per 10 000 deliveries
+	Per 100 000 live births

The maternal mortality rate in a developing country is usually:
+	50 or more
-	25–50
-	10–25
-	Less than ten.

Which of the following will cause most maternal deaths in a developing country?
+	Haemorrhage
-	General anaesthesia
-	Thromboembolism
-	Acute pyelonephritis
