# Test 4: Antepartum haemorrhage

1.	What is the definition of an antepartum haemorrhage?
	1.	Any vaginal haemorrhage between conception and delivery
	1.	Any vaginal haemorrhage during labour
	1.	Any vaginal haemorrhage between 24 weeks gestation and delivery
	1.	Any vaginal haemorrhage between 24 weeks and the onset of labour
2.	Antepartum haemorrhage is an important complication of pregnancy because:
	1.	It is a common cause of iron-deficiency anaemia.
	1.	The fetus may become anaemic.
	1.	It may be due to cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia.
	1.	Both the mother and fetus may die.
3.	Which of the following is an important sign of shock due to blood loss?
	1.	A fast pulse rate
	1.	A low haemoglobin concentration
	1.	Concentrated urine
	1.	Pyrexia
4.	Why is a speculum examination done on a patient with an antepartum haemorrhage?
	1.	To see how dilated the cervix is
	1.	To exclude a placenta praevia before a digital examination is done
	1.	To exclude a local cause of the bleeding from the vagina or cervix
	1.	To look for a blood clot in the vagina
5.	An antepartum haemorrhage with no fetal heart heard is usually caused by:
	1.	Placenta praevia
	1.	Abruptio placentae
	1.	Antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause
	1.	Trichomonal vaginitis
6.	What is the most likely cause of a massive antepartum haemorrhage that threatens the mother’s life?
	1.	Abruptio placentae
	1.	Rupture of the uterus
	1.	Cervical carcinoma
	1.	Placenta praevia
7.	Which of the following factors will place a patient at the highest risk of abruptio placentae? 
	1.	A history of abruptio placentae in a previous pregnancy.
	1.	Any of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
	1.	Intra-uterine growth retardation.
	1.	Cigarette smoking.
8.	Which of the following would suggest an abruptio placentae?
	1.	The uterus is tonically contracted and tender.
	1.	Fetal movements are usually present.
	1.	The haemoglobin concentration is low.
	1.	The uterus is relaxed and the fetal parts are easily felt.
9.	Which management would be correct if abruptio placentae with an intra-uterine death was diagnosed?
	1.	The fetus must be delivered by Caesarean section.
	1.	A vaginal examination must not be done because the patient has had an antepartum haemorrhage.
	1.	A vaginal examination must be done to rupture the membranes and, thereby, obtain a vaginal delivery.
	1.	The spontaneous onset of labour must be awaited.
10.	Which of the following patients is at an increased risk of placenta praevia?
	1.	A patient with one of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
	1.	A patient with a multiple pregnancy
	1.	A patient with intra-uterine growth retardation
	1.	A patient who smokes
11.	Vaginal bleeding due to placenta praevia is usually associated with:
	1.	Fetal parts that are difficult to feel and an absent fetal heartbeat
	1.	Engagement of the fetal head
	1.	A uterus that is relaxed and not tender on palpation
	1.	Lower abdominal pain
12.	In which of the following patients can placenta praevia be excluded?
	1.	A patient with a slight vaginal bleed
	1.	When 2/5 or less of the fetal head can be palpated above the pelvic brim on abdominal examination
	1.	A patient with a painless, bright red vaginal bleed
	1.	A patient with a breech presentation
13.	Which of the following will exclude a placenta praevia?
	1.	A careful speculum examination
	1.	A careful abdominal examination
	1.	The presence of fetal distress
	1.	Ultrasonography
14.	Following a small vaginal bleed at 34 weeks gestation, the diagnosis of placenta praevia is confirmed with ultrasonography. Which of the following will be the correct further management?
	1.	The fetus must be delivered immediately by Caesarean section.
	1.	A vaginal examination must be done in theatre immediately to confirm the diagnosis.
	1.	The patient must be hospitalised and managed conservatively until 36 weeks or until active bleeding starts again.
	1.	The membranes must be ruptured to induce labour.
15.	An antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause should be suspected:
	1.	When the history and abdominal examination are not suggestive of an abruptio placentae
	1.	When local causes of bleeding have been excluded by a speculum examination
	1.	When a placenta praevia is excluded
	1.	When all of the above causes of an antepartum haemorrhage have been excluded
16.	How should you manage a patient with an antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause?
	1.	The patient must be admitted to hospital where fetal movements should be carefully monitored, especially during the first 24 hours.
	1.	Because the risk of an abruptio placentae is so great, an emergency Caesarean section must be done.
	1.	Once the diagnosis is made, the patient should be discharged and followed up as a low-risk patient.
	1.	The patient must be hospitalised until 38 weeks of gestation, when labour should be induced.
17.	An antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause should always be regarded as a serious complication of pregnancy because:
	1.	Intra-uterine growth restriction is often present.
	1.	It may be caused by cervical cancer.
	1.	Abruptio placentae may be present.
	1.	Placenta praevia may be present.
18.	Which of the following is typical of a ‘show’?
	1.	A vaginal bleed that soaks a sanitary towel
	1.	A slight bleed consisting of blood mixed with mucus
	1.	A vaginal discharge mixed with blood
	1.	Contact bleeding from the cervix caused by a speculum examination
19.	If a speculum examination is done on a patient with a history suggestive of a blood-stained discharge, what finding would diagnose an antepartum haemorrhage?
	1.	Bleeding from a closed cervical os
	1.	A blood-stained discharge seen in the vagina
	1.	Contact bleeding when the speculum touches the cervix
	1.	Bulging membranes through a partially dilated cervix
20.	How should you manage a patient who presents at 30 weeks of gestation with a blood-stained vaginal discharge which is caused by vaginitis?
	1.	The urine should be tested with a reagent strip for protein, nitrites and leucocytes.
	1.	A cytology smear must be taken from the cervix to identify the organism causing the vaginitis.
	1.	A vaginal examination should be done in theatre as with any other patient who presents with an antepartum haemorrhage.
	1.	The patient and her partner must be treated with metronidazole (Flagyl).
