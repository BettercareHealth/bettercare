# Test 4: Antepartum haemorrhage

1.	What is the definition of an antepartum haemorrhage?
	-	Any vaginal haemorrhage between conception and delivery
	-	Any vaginal haemorrhage during labour
	+	Any vaginal haemorrhage between 24 weeks gestation and delivery
	-	Any vaginal haemorrhage between 24 weeks and the onset of labour
2.	Antepartum haemorrhage is an important complication of pregnancy because:
	-	It is a common cause of iron-deficiency anaemia.
	-	The fetus may become anaemic.
	-	It may be due to cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia.
	+	Both the mother and fetus may die.
3.	Which of the following is an important sign of shock due to blood loss?
	+	A fast pulse rate
	-	A low haemoglobin concentration
	-	Concentrated urine
	-	Pyrexia
4.	Why is a speculum examination done on a patient with an antepartum haemorrhage?
	-	To see how dilated the cervix is
	-	To exclude a placenta praevia before a digital examination is done
	+	To exclude a local cause of the bleeding from the vagina or cervix
	-	To look for a blood clot in the vagina
5.	An antepartum haemorrhage with no fetal heart heard is usually caused by:
	-	Placenta praevia
	+	Abruptio placentae
	-	Antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause
	-	Trichomonal vaginitis
6.	What is the most likely cause of a massive antepartum haemorrhage that threatens the mother’s life?
	-	Abruptio placentae
	-	Rupture of the uterus
	-	Cervical carcinoma
	+	Placenta praevia
7.	Which of the following factors will place a patient at the highest risk of abruptio placentae? 
	+	A history of abruptio placentae in a previous pregnancy.
	-	Any of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
	-	Intra-uterine growth retardation.
	-	Cigarette smoking.
8.	Which of the following would suggest an abruptio placentae?
	+	The uterus is tonically contracted and tender.
	-	Fetal movements are usually present.
	-	The haemoglobin concentration is low.
	-	The uterus is relaxed and the fetal parts are easily felt.
9.	Which management would be correct if abruptio placentae with an intra-uterine death was diagnosed?
	-	The fetus must be delivered by Caesarean section.
	-	A vaginal examination must not be done because the patient has had an antepartum haemorrhage.
	+	A vaginal examination must be done to rupture the membranes and, thereby, obtain a vaginal delivery.
	-	The spontaneous onset of labour must be awaited.
10.	Which of the following patients is at an increased risk of placenta praevia?
	-	A patient with one of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
	+	A patient with a multiple pregnancy
	-	A patient with intra-uterine growth retardation
	-	A patient who smokes
11.	Vaginal bleeding due to placenta praevia is usually associated with:
	-	Fetal parts that are difficult to feel and an absent fetal heartbeat
	-	Engagement of the fetal head
	+	A uterus that is relaxed and not tender on palpation
	-	Lower abdominal pain
12.	In which of the following patients can placenta praevia be excluded?
	-	A patient with a slight vaginal bleed
	+	When 2/5 or less of the fetal head can be palpated above the pelvic brim on abdominal examination
	-	A patient with a painless, bright red vaginal bleed
	-	A patient with a breech presentation
13.	Which of the following will exclude a placenta praevia?
	-	A careful speculum examination
	-	A careful abdominal examination
	-	The presence of fetal distress
	+	Ultrasonography
14.	Following a small vaginal bleed at 34 weeks gestation, the diagnosis of placenta praevia is confirmed with ultrasonography. Which of the following will be the correct further management?
	-	The fetus must be delivered immediately by Caesarean section.
	-	A vaginal examination must be done in theatre immediately to confirm the diagnosis.
	+	The patient must be hospitalised and managed conservatively until 36 weeks or until active bleeding starts again.
	-	The membranes must be ruptured to induce labour.
15.	An antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause should be suspected:
	-	When the history and abdominal examination are not suggestive of an abruptio placentae
	-	When local causes of bleeding have been excluded by a speculum examination
	-	When a placenta praevia is excluded
	+	When all of the above causes of an antepartum haemorrhage have been excluded
16.	How should you manage a patient with an antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause?
	+	The patient must be admitted to hospital where fetal movements should be carefully monitored, especially during the first 24 hours.
	-	Because the risk of an abruptio placentae is so great, an emergency Caesarean section must be done.
	-	Once the diagnosis is made, the patient should be discharged and followed up as a low-risk patient.
	-	The patient must be hospitalised until 38 weeks of gestation, when labour should be induced.
17.	An antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause should always be regarded as a serious complication of pregnancy because:
	-	Intra-uterine growth restriction is often present.
	-	It may be caused by cervical cancer.
	+	Abruptio placentae may be present.
	-	Placenta praevia may be present.
18.	Which of the following is typical of a ‘show’?
	-	A vaginal bleed that soaks a sanitary towel
	+	A slight bleed consisting of blood mixed with mucus
	-	A vaginal discharge mixed with blood
	-	Contact bleeding from the cervix caused by a speculum examination
19.	If a speculum examination is done on a patient with a history suggestive of a blood-stained discharge, what finding would diagnose an antepartum haemorrhage?
	+	Bleeding from a closed cervical os
	-	A blood-stained discharge seen in the vagina
	-	Contact bleeding when the speculum touches the cervix
	-	Bulging membranes through a partially dilated cervix
20.	How should you manage a patient who presents at 30 weeks of gestation with a blood-stained vaginal discharge which is caused by vaginitis?
	-	The urine should be tested with a reagent strip for protein, nitrites and leucocytes.
	-	A cytology smear must be taken from the cervix to identify the organism causing the vaginitis.
	-	A vaginal examination should be done in theatre as with any other patient who presents with an antepartum haemorrhage.
	+	The patient and her partner must be treated with metronidazole (Flagyl).
