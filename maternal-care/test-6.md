# Test 6: Monitoring the condition of the mother during the first stage of labour

1.	What is a partogram?
	1.	A chart for recording cervical dilatation only
	1.	An observation chart to record the clinical findings during the antenatal period
	1.	A machine to record the fetal heart rate
	1.	A chart to record the progress of labour together with the maternal and fetal condition
2.	During the first stage of labour a partogram must be used:
	1.	On all patients
	1.	Only on high-risk patients
	1.	Only in level 1 clinics
	1.	Only in level 2 and 3 hospitals
3.	Which of the following indicates that the general condition of a patient in the first stage of labour is normal?
	1.	The patient’s temperature, pulse rate, and blood pressure are normal
	1.	The patient is at ease and relaxed between contractions and does not appear pale
	1.	The urine output is normal and ketonuria is not present
	1.	The patient’s blood pressure is normal and proteinuria is not present
4.	The correct management of a 17-year-old primigravida patient who appears very anxious and complains of painful contractions in early labour is:
	1.	The patient must immediately receive analgesics.
	1.	A Caesarean section must be done.
	1.	The patient must be comforted and reassured and receive appropriate analgesia. If possible, someone she knows should stay with her.
	1.	The membranes must be ruptured to ensure a rapid progress of labour.
5.	What is the normal maternal temperature during labour?
	1.	35.5–36.0 °C
	1.	36.0–37.0 °C
	1.	36.5–37.5 °C
	1.	37.0–38.0 °C
6.	Why is maternal pyrexia an important complication during the first stage of labour?
	1.	Maternal pyrexia may cause maternal exhaustion and oliguria.
	1.	Maternal pyrexia may cause convulsions.
	1.	Maternal pyrexia may cause hypertension during labour.
	1.	Maternal pyrexia may be caused by an infection which could be dangerous to the patient.
7.	What is the normal maternal pulse rate during labour?
	1.	60–80
	1.	80–100
	1.	100–120
	1.	120–140
8.	What causes a rapid maternal pulse during labour?
	1.	Fetal distress
	1.	Hypertension
	1.	Pyrexia
	1.	Ketonuria
9.	How often should the blood pressure be monitored in a low-risk patient during the latent phase of labour?
	1.	Every 15 minutes
	1.	Every 30 minutes
	1.	Hourly
	1.	2-hourly
10.	Which of the following may cause hypertension during labour?
	1.	Anxiety
	1.	Fetal distress
	1.	Chorioamnionitis
	1.	Anaemia
11.	Which of the following would be the best management if a patient’s blood pressure was 90/50 mm Hg while she was lying on her back?
	1.	The patient must change into the lateral position and the blood pressure measurement should be repeated after a further 1 to 2 minutes.
	1.	As maternal hypotension may cause fetal distress, the fetal heart rate must be checked immediately.
	1.	The patient should be reassured that some patients normally have a low blood pressure and, therefore, there is no need for concern.
	1.	As blood loss is the most likely cause for hypotension, active resuscitation must be started immediately.
12.	A common clinical sign of shock is:
	1.	Pyrexia
	1.	Bradycardia
	1.	Hypertension
	1.	A cold and sweaty skin
13.	The definition of oliguria is a urine output of less than:
	1.	10 ml per hour
	1.	20 ml per hour
	1.	50 ml per hour
	1.	100 ml per hour
14.	Oliguria is an important sign of:
	1.	Dehydration
	1.	Pyelonephritis
	1.	Anxiety
	1.	Heart failure
15.	Which of the following statements is correct?
	1.	All patients should receive an intravenous infusion from the time of admission to the labour ward.
	1.	Oral fluids must be given to all patients until full cervical dilatation is reached.
	1.	All patients to be delivered vaginally must be encouraged to take oral fluids while in the active phase of labour.
	1.	A 50 ml ampoule of 50% dextrose should be given intravenously as soon as ketonuria develops during labour.
16.	Infection of the urinary tract may cause:
	1.	1+ proteinuria
	1.	2+ proteinuria
	1.	3+ proteinuria
	1.	4+ proteinuria
17.	Ketonuria during labour:
	1.	Is always abnormal and must be treated
	1.	Is an important sign of fetal distress
	1.	May be seen in normal patients
	1.	Is a sign of renal disease
18.	Which of the following is a sign of maternal exhaustion during labour?
	1.	Bradycardia
	1.	Proteinuria
	1.	A dry mouth and oliguria
	1.	Pallor and hypotension
19.	What may cause maternal exhaustion during labour?
	1.	Chorioamnionitis
	1.	Preterm labour
	1.	Placenta praevia
	1.	Prolonged labour
20.	How should you treat a patient with maternal exhaustion?
	1.	Stop the contractions with nifedipine (Adalat).
	1.	Give oxygen by face mask.
	1.	Give 2 litres of Ringer’s lactate with 5% dextrose by intravenous infusion.
	1.	Deliver the infant by Caesarean section.
