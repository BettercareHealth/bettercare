# Test 6: Monitoring the condition of the mother during the first stage of labour

Please choose the one most correct answer to each question or statement.

1.	What is a partogram?
	-	A chart for recording cervical dilatation only
	-	An observation chart to record the clinical findings during the antenatal period
	-	A machine to record the fetal heart rate
	+	A chart to record the progress of labour together with the maternal and fetal condition
2.	During the first stage of labour a partogram must be used:
	+	On all patients
	-	Only on high-risk patients
	-	Only in level 1 clinics
	-	Only in level 2 and 3 hospitals
3.	Which of the following indicates that the general condition of a patient in the first stage of labour is normal?
	-	The patient’s temperature, pulse rate, and blood pressure are normal
	+	The patient is at ease and relaxed between contractions and does not appear pale
	-	The urine output is normal and ketonuria is not present
	-	The patient’s blood pressure is normal and proteinuria is not present
4.	The correct management of a 17-year-old primigravida patient who appears very anxious and complains of painful contractions in early labour is:
	-	The patient must immediately receive analgesics.
	-	A Caesarean section must be done.
	+	The patient must be comforted and reassured and receive appropriate analgesia. If possible, someone she knows should stay with her.
	-	The membranes must be ruptured to ensure a rapid progress of labour.
5.	What is the normal maternal temperature during labour?
	-	35.5–36.0 °C
	+	36.0–37.0 °C
	-	36.5–37.5 °C
	-	37.0–38.0 °C
6.	Why is maternal pyrexia an important complication during the first stage of labour?
	-	Maternal pyrexia may cause maternal exhaustion and oliguria.
	-	Maternal pyrexia may cause convulsions.
	-	Maternal pyrexia may cause hypertension during labour.
	+	Maternal pyrexia may be caused by an infection which could be dangerous to the patient.
7.	What is the normal maternal pulse rate during labour?
	-	60–80
	+	80–100
	-	100–120
	-	120–140
8.	What causes a rapid maternal pulse during labour?
	-	Fetal distress
	-	Hypertension
	+	Pyrexia
	-	Ketonuria
9.	How often should the blood pressure be monitored in a low-risk patient during the latent phase of labour?
	-	Every 15 minutes
	-	Every 30 minutes
	-	Hourly
	+	2-hourly
10.	Which of the following may cause hypertension during labour?
	+	Anxiety
	-	Fetal distress
	-	Chorioamnionitis
	-	Anaemia
11.	Which of the following would be the best management if a patient’s blood pressure was 90/50 mm Hg while she was lying on her back?
	+	The patient must change into the lateral position and the blood pressure measurement should be repeated after a further 1 to 2 minutes.
	-	As maternal hypotension may cause fetal distress, the fetal heart rate must be checked immediately.
	-	The patient should be reassured that some patients normally have a low blood pressure and, therefore, there is no need for concern.
	-	As blood loss is the most likely cause for hypotension, active resuscitation must be started immediately.
12.	A common clinical sign of shock is:
	-	Pyrexia
	-	Bradycardia
	-	Hypertension
	+	A cold and sweaty skin
13.	The definition of oliguria is a urine output of less than:
	-	10 ml per hour
	+	20 ml per hour
	-	50 ml per hour
	-	100 ml per hour
14.	Oliguria is an important sign of:
	+	Dehydration
	-	Pyelonephritis
	-	Anxiety
	-	Heart failure
15.	Which of the following statements is correct?
	-	All patients should receive an intravenous infusion from the time of admission to the labour ward.
	-	Oral fluids must be given to all patients until full cervical dilatation is reached.
	+	All patients to be delivered vaginally must be encouraged to take oral fluids while in the active phase of labour.
	-	A 50 ml ampoule of 50% dextrose should be given intravenously as soon as ketonuria develops during labour.
16.	Infection of the urinary tract may cause:
	+	1+ proteinuria
	-	2+ proteinuria
	-	3+ proteinuria
	-	4+ proteinuria
17.	Ketonuria during labour:
	-	Is always abnormal and must be treated
	-	Is an important sign of fetal distress
	+	May be seen in normal patients
	-	Is a sign of renal disease
18.	Which of the following is a sign of maternal exhaustion during labour?
	-	Bradycardia
	-	Proteinuria
	+	A dry mouth and oliguria
	-	Pallor and hypotension
19.	What may cause maternal exhaustion during labour?
	-	Chorioamnionitis
	-	Preterm labour
	-	Placenta praevia
	+	Prolonged labour
20.	How should you treat a patient with maternal exhaustion?
	-	Stop the contractions with nifedipine (Adalat).
	-	Give oxygen by face mask.
	+	Give 2 litres of Ringer’s lactate with 5% dextrose by intravenous infusion.
	-	Deliver the infant by Caesarean section.
