# Test 10: Managing pain during labour

1.	Analgesia means:
	1.	The relief of pain
	1.	Relieving anxiety
	1.	Putting the patient to sleep
	1.	All of the above
2.	Anaesthesia means:
	1.	The relief of pain
	1.	Relieving anxiety
	1.	Loss of all sensation
	1.	Putting the patient to sleep
3.	Which of the following statements is correct?
	1.	All patients experience severe pain during labour.
	1.	The severity of pain experienced during labour varies widely between different patients.
	1.	Pain is only experienced during labour when the cervix is almost fully dilated.
	1.	Pain is only experienced when the patient is in the second stage of labour.
4.	Why do anxiety and fear make the pain of labour worse?
	1.	Anxiety increases the strength of uterine contractions.
	1.	Anxiety increases the duration of uterine contractions.
	1.	Anxiety increases the frequency of uterine contractions.
	1.	Anxiety lowers a patient’s pain threshold.
5.	Pain relief during labour:
	1.	Should only be provided by powerful analgesics which are known to be effective
	1.	Starts with the preparation for labour during the antenatal period
	1.	Is only needed if the patient receives an oxytocin infusion
	1.	Is only needed if the patient does not have her partner or another family member with her
6.	Which of the following statements about rubbing a patient’s back during labour is correct?
	1.	Rubbing a patient’s back is an ‘old wives’ tale’ and is of no value.
	1.	It should not be done as physical contact with the patient should be avoided.
	1.	The pain impulses from the uterus and cervix are experienced as less painful if the patient’s lower back is rubbed.
	1.	There is no physiological reason why rubbing the patient’s back should relieve labour pains.
7.	Which of the following statements about pain relief in labour is correct?
	1.	The relief of pain often speeds up the progress of labour.
	1.	The relief of pain often slows the progress of labour.
	1.	Patients must accept pain as part of normal labour.
	1.	Pain relief in labour should only be given to patients who obviously are suffering severe pain.
8.	When should a patient be given pain relief in labour?
	1.	When a patient’s cervix is 4 to 6 cm dilated
	1.	When a patient is having 3 strong contractions in 10 minutes
	1.	When a patient reaches the active phase of the first stage of labour
	1.	When a patient asks for pain relief
9.	Promethazine (Phenergan) or hydroxyzine (Aterax) should always be given together with pethidine for the relief of pain during labour because:
	1.	They have a sedative effect
	1.	They decrease nausea and vomiting which are common side effects of pethidine
	1.	They increase the analgesic effect of pethidine
	1.	All of the above
10.	Pethidine causes analgesia by:
	1.	Acting on the central nervous system
	1.	Acting on the uterine muscle
	1.	Acting on the peripheral nerves
	1.	Making the patient sleepy so that she is not aware of the pain
11.	What is a dangerous complication of an overdose of pethidine?
	1.	Suppression of uterine contractions
	1.	Respiratory depression in the patient
	1.	Convulsions
	1.	Excessive drowsiness
12.	Pethidine and promethazine (Phenergan) or hydroxyzine (Aterax) should only be given if:
	1.	The cervical dilatation is 4 cm or less in a multigravida patient
	1.	The patient is unlikely to deliver in the next 4 to 6 hours
	1.	The intramuscular route is used
	1.	It is the most appropriate method of analgesia; the degree of cervical dilatation and the expected time of delivery are of little importance
13.	Pethidine may cause respiratory depression in the newborn infant if:
	1.	The drug is given when the patient’s cervix is more than 4 cm dilated
	1.	The drug is given less than 6 hours before delivery
	1.	More than 50 mg pethidine is given
	1.	Promethazine or hydroxyzine is not given together with the pethidine
14.	The duration of action when pethidine is given by intramuscular injection is usually:
	1.	1 hour
	1.	2 hours
	1.	4 hours
	1.	8 hours
15.	What is the correct management of a newborn infant who does not breathe well if the mother has been given pethidine during labour?
	1.	The infant should be ventilated until the effect of the pethidine wears off.
	1.	The infant should be given an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose.
	1.	The infant should be given mask oxygen while being stimulated by gently flicking the soles of the feet.
	1.	The infant must be ventilated and given naloxone until the effect of the pethidine is reversed.
16.	What is the correct management of a teenager who has not received antenatal care and is unco-operative and frightened during labour?
	1.	She should be given a sedative such as diazepam (Valium).
	1.	It is best to let her suffer as this will ensure that she does not fall pregnant again in a hurry.
	1.	The staff should attempt to communicate with her while the tranquillising effect of promethazine or hydroxyzine and the analgesic effect of pethidine should also help.
	1.	The patient should be delivered by Caesarean section to avoid a very difficult vaginal delivery.
17.	Which of the following statements about the nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture (Entonox) is correct?
	1.	It is completely safe.
	1.	It always provides excellent pain relief.
	1.	It may cause respiratory depression in the newborn infant.
	1.	Excessive use may cause respiratory depression in the mother.
18.	Which of the following is a complication of an overdose of local anaesthetic?
	1.	Respiratory depression in the mother
	1.	Respiratory depression in the newborn infant
	1.	Convulsions
	1.	Nausea and vomiting
19.	What is the maximum dose of 1% lignocaine that can safely be infiltrated locally in a patient of average weight?
	1.	50 ml
	1.	40 ml
	1.	30 ml
	1.	20 ml
20.	Why is metoclopramide (Maxalon) given intravenously 15 minutes before a general anaesthetic?
	1.	It has a sedative effect on the patient.
	1.	Stomach emptying is increased.
	1.	It neutralises stomach acid.
	1.	It reduces intra-abdominal pressure.
