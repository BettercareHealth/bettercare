# Test 13: Medical problems during pregnancy and the puerperium

1.	A patient with cystitis usually complains of:
	1.	Headache
	1.	Fever and rigors
	1.	Dysuria and frequency
	1.	Backache
2.	Cystitis is treated by:
	1.	Asking the patient to increase her oral fluid intake
	1.	Prescribing a single oral dose of amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole
	1.	Giving 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin intramuscularly
	1.	Giving ampicillin 1 g intravenously every 6 hours until the symptoms stop
3.	A patient with asymptomatic bacteriuria has:
	1.	No symptoms
	1.	Fever
	1.	Nocturia
	1.	Lower abdominal pain
4.	It is important to treat patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy because:
	1.	The patient is seriously ill
	1.	One third will develop septic shock during pregnancy
	1.	One third will develop cystitis during pregnancy
	1.	One third will develop acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy
5.	How is asymptomatic bacteriuria diagnosed?
	1.	By detecting proteinuria
	1.	By testing for nitrites and leucocytes in the urine
	1.	By examining a sample of urine under the microscope
	1.	By culturing a sample of midstream urine
6.	Which clinical sign suggests that the patient has acute pyelonephritis?
	1.	Tenderness over the bladder
	1.	Oedema
	1.	Severe tenderness to percussion over one or both renal angles
	1.	Severe tenderness in the upper abdomen
7.	What is the correct management of a patient with acute pyelonephritis?
	1.	Amoxicillin (Amoxil) 3 g as a single oral dose
	1.	Amoxicillin (Amoxil) 500 mg 8-hourly by mouth for seven days as an outpatient
	1.	The patient must be admitted to hospital and receive amoxicillin (Amoxil) 500 mg 8-hourly by mouth for seven days
	1.	The patient must be admitted to hospital and receive an intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic
8.	What is the definition of anaemia in pregnancy?
	1.	A haemoglobin concentration of less than 12 g/dl
	1.	A haemoglobin concentration of less than 11 g/dl
	1.	A haemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dl
	1.	Any patient with shortness of breath irrespective of the haemoglobin concentration
9.	What is the commonest cause of anaemia in pregnancy?
	1.	Iron deficiency
	1.	Folic acid deficiency
	1.	Infection
	1.	Blood loss
10.	The management of anaemia in pregnancy depends on:
	1.	The presence or absence of oedema
	1.	Whether the patient is pale or not
	1.	The presence or absence of shortness of breath and tachycardia
	1.	The presence or absence of hypotension
11.	What should be the management of an anaemic patient if the haemoglobin concentration is less than 8 g/dl and the gestational age 37 weeks?
	1.	Admit to hospital for bed rest and a good diet
	1.	Admit to hospital for a blood transfusion
	1.	Give an intramuscular injection of iron-dextran (Imferon)
	1.	Prescribe 1 ferrous sulphate tablet 3 times a day until delivery
12.	What should be the management of a patient in the puerperium who has normal observations and has no bleeding, but has a haemoglobin concentration of 9 g/dl?
	1.	Reassure her that no treatment is needed.
	1.	Give her a blood transfusion.
	1.	Advise her to eat a good diet.
	1.	Prescribe an oral iron supplement.
13.	Which patients should receive supplementary iron during pregnancy?
	1.	All patients
	1.	Only patients with a haemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dl
	1.	Only patients with a full blood count suggesting iron deficiency
	1.	Patients from communities where iron deficiency is common or socio-economic circumstances are poor
14.	What should be done if a patient has side effects from the iron supplementation?
	1.	She should be reassured and the importance of taking the iron tablets should be stressed.
	1.	The tablets should be taken with meals.
	1.	The iron tablets should be stopped.
	1.	The iron tablets should be stopped and metoclopramide (Maxalon) given.
15.	A patient with asymptomatic heart valve disease:
	1.	Must be admitted to hospital for bed rest from 34 weeks gestation
	1.	Must be delivered in hospital because of the high risk of pulmonary oedema during labour and the first day of the puerperium
	1.	Should be classified as low risk and delivered in a primary perinatal-care clinic
	1.	Should be given Syntometrine after delivery to prevent a postpartum haemorrhage
16.	A patient with heart valve disease should:
	1.	Be nursed on her side during labour with her body raised with pillows to 45 degrees
	1.	Be nursed on her side during labour with her body flat on the bed
	1.	Be delivered in the lithotomy position
	1.	Be heavily sedated during labour
17.	Which complication is common if diabetes is not well controlled in the third trimester?
	1.	Anaemia
	1.	Pre-eclampsia
	1.	Oligohydramnios
	1.	Pulmonary oedema
18.	Which complication is common in the second stage of labour in patients with poorly controlled diabetes?
	1.	Precipitous (sudden, unexpected) delivery
	1.	Impacted shoulders
	1.	Hypoglycaemia
	1.	Hyperglycaemia
19.	A random blood glucose concentration should be done when:
	1.	1+ ketonuria is detected for the first time in pregnancy.
	1.	1+ glucosuria is detected for the first time in pregnancy.
	1.	Patients attend their first antenatal care clinic.
	1.	Patients attend their second antenatal care clinic.
20.	Which random blood glucose concentration is normal?
	1.	Less than 4 mmol/l
	1.	Less than 6 mmol/l
	1.	Less than 8 mmol/l
	1.	Less than 11 mmol/l
