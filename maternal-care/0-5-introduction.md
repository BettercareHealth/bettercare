# Introduction

## About the Bettercare series

Originally developed by the [Perinatal Education Programme](http://pepcourse.co.za/), and published by Electric Book Works. Bettercare material is widely used by government and private hospitals, non-profit organisations and training institutions in South Africa and other countries. Our learning programmes bring the latest developments in child, perinatal and HIV care to healthcare professionals working in challenging circumstances. We make high-quality, affordable and up-to-date training possible in every facility, regardless of its history, resources or geographical location.

Bettercare is now an independent Non-Profit and Public Benefit Organisation. Our aim is to continue creating accessible educational resources that are able to empower health care workers in South Africa and around the world.

Our methodology, developed by the Perinatal Education Programme since 1989, has been [proven in controlled studies](http://bettercare.co.za/about/research/) to improve knowledge, skills and patient care practices in health professionals.


## Why decentralised learning? 

Continuing education for health workers traditionally consists of courses and workshops run by formal trainers at large central hospitals. These courses are expensive to attend, often far away from the health workers’ families and places of work, and the content frequently fails to address the biggest healthcare challenges of poor, rural communities.

To help solve these many problems, a self-help decentralised learning method has been developed which addresses the needs of professional healthcare workers, especially those in under-resourced regions.
We provide the learning programme, you run the course. A learning programme is the curriculum and study material you need to run a course, all in one book. Whether you lead a study group or manage formal training, our learning programmes make your job simpler and easier.

Bettercare learning programmes have helped thousands of nurses, midwives, doctors and students increase their knowledge, boost their confidence, and improve patient care. You can implement Bettercare learning programmes in your institution right now.

## Bettercare Online Learning Station

The Bettercare Learning Station is a simple website that can be used on tablets, computers or phones. It can also be set up as a dedicated touchscreen Learning Station in your institution. 

The Learning Station is freely accessible online and includes all of the courses that we currently have. The material provided is always the most up to date and relevant information and includes the full course content as well as the tests/quizzes which are provide in the books at the end of each chapter. Each chapter has 20 multiple choice quiz which can be taken. All students are able to make use of this to supplement their study by using their mobile phone or computer to read while they are online.

All users may also complete the provided chapter tests/quizzes by registering on the website for free. The process is quick, only requiring their email address or mobile number and a password. We can then recognise the test results for each user by their mobile number or email address, depending on which information was given. Users are then able to take the test and receive a score of their results plus advice regarding where they went wrong. At the bottom of the results page each user will have the option to submit their results for points.

The Bettercare methodology is around students empowering themselves and being able to study on their own without feeling as though they are being watched. Only when they believe they have mastered a subject do they submit their results and the users are in full control of this process. Built into our privacy policy is the clause that only the information which users have agreed to make available may be used to generate reports. 

You can access the learning station here: [ls.bettercare.co.za](http://ls.bettercare.co.za/)

## Format of the courses

### Objectives

The learning objectives are clearly stated at the start of each chapter. They help the participant to identify and understand the important lessons to be learned.

### Pre- and post-tests

There is a multiple-choice test of 20 questions for each chapter at the end of the book. Participants are encouraged to take a pre-test before starting each chapter, to benchmark their current knowledge, and a post-test after each chapter, to assess what they have learned. Self-assessment allows participants to monitor their own progress through the course.

### Question-and-answer format

Theoretical knowledge is presented in a question-and-answer format, which encourages the learner to actively participate in the learning process. In this way, the participant is led step by step through the definitions, causes, diagnosis, prevention, dangers and management of a particular problem.

Participants should cover the answer for a few minutes with a piece of paper while thinking about the correct reply to each question. This method helps learning. 

Simplified flow diagrams are also used, where necessary, to indicate the correct approach to diagnosing or managing a particular problem. 

Each question is identified with the number of the chapter, followed by the number of the question, e.g. 5-23.

> Important practical lessons are emphasised like this.

Note
:	Additional, non-essential information is provided for interest and given in notes like this. These facts are not used in the case studies or included in the multiple-choice questions.

### Case studies

Each chapter closes with a few case studies which encourage the participant to consolidate and apply what was learned earlier in the chapter. These studies give the participant an opportunity to see the problem as it usually presents itself in the clinic or hospital. The participant should attempt to answer each question in the case study before reading the correct answer. Case studies without the correct answers are also used at the start of some chapters to identify common clinical problems that need to be addressed.

### Practical skills

Some Bettercare books include chapters on practical skills that need to be practised, preferably in groups. These skills chapters list essential equipment and present step-by-step instructions on how to perform each task, often with pictures. If participants are not familiar with a practical skill, they should ask an appropriate medical or nursing colleague to demonstrate the clinical skill to them. In this way, senior personnel are encouraged to share their skills with their colleagues.

### Bettercare tests and examinations

Self-evaluation is the most important part of learning. For every chapter, participants take a short self-test before and after studying each chapter. This way participants can see their knowledge improve, and can address specific weaknesses.

Tests are included in our printed books and ebooks, and participants can take them for free on our [Learning Station](http://ls.bettercare.co.za/) for instant results.

Participants need to achieve at least 80% in the examination in order to successfully complete the course. Successful candidates will be sent a digital certificate which states that they have successfully completed that course. 


## Contributors

The developers of our learning materials are a multi-disciplinary team of nurses, midwives, obstetricians, neonatologists, and general paediatricians. The development and review of all course material is overseen by the Editor-in-Chief, emeritus Professor Dave Woods, a previous head of neonatal medicine at the University of Cape Town who now consults to UNICEF and the WHO.

### Perinatal Education Trust

The [Perinatal Education Programme (PEP)](http://www.pepcourse.co.za/) is produced and distributed by the Perinatal Education Trust, a non-profit organisation which aims to improve the care of pregnant women and their newborn infants, especially in poor, rural communities.

PEP presents a unique form of self-help training for health professionals which places the responsibility for continuing education on the participants themselves. It is cheap, appropriate, practical and does not require a teacher.

### Breast Courses for Nurses

The [Breast Course for Nurses](http://www.breastcourse4nurses.co.za/) (BCN) combines distance education with a residential course. The emphasis is on learning rather than teaching. The Breast Course for Nurses can be adapted to suit the needs of the health care providers being trained.

### Academic Unit for Infection Prevention and Control at Stellenbosch University

The [Academic Unit for Infection Prevention and Control](http://www.sun.ac.za/english/faculty/healthsciences/Pages/Infectious-Diseases%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B.aspx) (UIPC) is based at Tygerberg Academic Hospital and the FMHS. It resides under the Division of Community Health and is also a member of the Centre for Infectious Diseases.

The UPIC focuses on integrated research, training and service provision. The unit offers a range of tailor-made courses in infection prevention and control (IPC) as well as decontamination and sterilization for Sterile Service Departments (SSDs). In addition, courses are offered for specialities such as the operating theatre, renal dialysis, intensive care and infectious diseases.

### Eduhealthcare

### Perinatal Mental Health Project

The Perinatal Mental Health Project of the Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health at the University of Cape Town aims at improving the mental health of women both during pregnancy and in the months afterwards. The project targets women who are at risk of depression and anxiety. 

### The Infection Control Africa Network

The Infection Control Africa Network (ICAN) promotes and facilitates the establishment of infection control programmes. This includes promotion of surveillance for and reduction of healthcare-associated infections, and antimicrobial stewardship activities through education. ICAN works with infection prevention structures in Africa and other international health-related associations.

## Updating the course material

Bettercare learning materials are regularly updated to keep up with developments and changes in healthcare protocols. Course participants can make important contributions to the continual improvement of Bettercare books by reporting factual or language errors, by identifying sections that are difficult to understand, and by suggesting additions or improvements to the contents. Details of alternative or better forms of management would be particularly appreciated. Please send any comments or suggestions to the Editor-in-Chief, Professor Dave Woods.
