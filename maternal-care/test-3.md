# Test 3: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

1.	What is the definition of hypertension in pregnancy?
	-	A diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or above and/or a systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg or above
	1.	A diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or above and/or a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or above
	1.	A diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or above and/or a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or above
	1.	A rise in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg.
2.	What is the definition of significant proteinuria in pregnancy?
	1.	A trace of protein
	1.	1+ protein or more
	1.	2+ protein or more
	1.	3+ protein
3.	How should you define pre-eclampsia?
	1.	Hypertension and proteinuria presenting before the start of pregnancy
	1.	Hypertension and proteinuria presenting in the first half of pregnancy
	1.	Hypertension and proteinuria presenting in the second half of pregnancy
	1.	Hypertension and proteinuria presenting any time in pregnancy
4.	What is the correct definition of chronic hypertension?
	1.	Hypertension, without proteinuria, that is present in the first half of pregnancy
	1.	Hypertension, together with proteinuria, that is present in the first half of pregnancy
	1.	Hypertension that is present in the first half of pregnancy, plus proteinuria that presents in the second half of pregnancy
	1.	Hypertension alone which is present at the time of booking at 28 weeks

	1.	Most pregnant women develop pre-eclampsia.
	1.	About 25% of all pregnant women develop pre-eclampsia.

	1.	Congenital malformations
	1.	Heart failure due to hypertension
	1.	Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn
	1.	Intra-uterine growth restriction
7.	Pre-eclampsia may cause fetal distress because it results in:

	1.	Severe protein loss in the mother’s urine
	1.	Congenital abnormalities caused by antihypertensive drugs
8.	A patient with pre-eclampsia who develops a diastolic blood pressure of 105 mm Hg and 2+ proteinuria at 36 weeks of pregnancy should be graded as having:
	1.	Pre-eclampsia

	1.	Imminent eclampsia
	1.	Eclampsia
9.	What is an important sign of imminent eclampsia?
	1.	3 + proteinuria
	1.	Increased tendon reflexes
	1.	A diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or more
	1.	Tenderness on palpating the calves
10.	A patient with pre-eclampsia has a diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg and 1+ proteinuria. She complains of flashes of light in front of her eyes and upper abdominal pain. In which of the following grades of pre-eclampsia should you put this patient?
	1.	Pre-eclampsia
	1.	Severe pre-eclampsia
	1.	Imminent eclampsia

14.	Which one of the following is the method of delivery usually chosen in a patient with pre-eclampsia?
	1.	Caesarean section
	1.	Surgical induction followed by vaginal delivery at 34 weeks
	1.	Surgical induction followed by vaginal delivery if 36 weeks gestation has been reached.
	1.	Waiting until 42 weeks for a spontaneous onset of labour.
15.	What is an important complication of pre-eclampsia?
	1.	Placenta praevia
	1.	Oedema of the face
	1.	Glycosuria
	1.	Intracerebral haemorrhage
16.	Which of the following is the correct method of treatment for a patient with severe pre-eclampsia?
	1.	The patient should be stabilised first, then be moved to a level 2 hospital for further management.
	1.	The patient should immediately be rushed to the nearest level 3 hospital for stabilisation.
	1.	The patient should be managed at a level 1 hospital.
	1.	The infant must immediately be delivered by Caesarean section at a level 2 hospital.

20.	How should a patient, who feels well but has a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg at 36 weeks gestation, be managed? At all her previous antenatal visits, her blood pressure was normal, and she has no proteinuria.
	1.	She must be given an intramuscular injection of dihydralazine (Nepresol).
	1.	She must be hospitalised.
	1.	Alpha methyldopa (Aldomed) must be prescribed and weekly antenatal visits should be arranged with additional visits if necessary.
