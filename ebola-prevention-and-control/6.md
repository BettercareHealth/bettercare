#### Note

*	Glycerol: used an humectant, but other emollients may be used for skin care, provided they are cheap, widely available and miscible in water and alcohol and do not add to toxicity or promote allergy.
*	Hydrogen peroxide: used to inactivate contaminating bacterial spores in the solution and is not an active substance for hand antisepsis. 
*	Any further additive to both formulations should be clearly labelled and non-toxic in case of accidental ingestion.
*	A colorant may be added to allow differentiation from other fluids, but should not add to toxicity, promote allergy, or interfere with antimicrobial properties. The addition of perfumes or dyes is not recommended due to the risk of allergic reactions.

#### General information

Labelling should be in accordance with national guidelines and should include the following:

*	Name of institution, date of production and batch number
*	WHO-handrub solution
*	For external use only
*	Avoid contact with eyes
*	Keep out of reach of children
*	Use: Apply a palmful of alcohol-based handrub and cover all surfaces of the hands. Rub hands until dry.
*	Composition: Ethanol or isopropanol, glycerol and hydrogen peroxide
*	Flammable: Keep away from flame and heat.

#### Production and storage facilities

*	Production and storage facilities should ideally be air-conditioned and cool rooms. No naked flames or smoking should be permitted in these areas.
*	WHO-recommended handrub formulations should not be produced in quantities exceeding 50 litres locally or in central pharmacies lacking specialised air-conditioning and ventilation. 
*	Since undiluted ethanol is highly flammable and may ignite at temperatures as low as 10°C, production facilities should directly dilute it to the above-mentioned concentration. The flashpoints of ethanol 80% (v/v) and of isopropyl alcohol 75% (v/v) are 17.5°C and 19°C, respectively. 
*	National safety guidelines and local legal requirements must be adhered to the storage of ingredients and the final product.   

#### Method: 10 litre preparations

These can be prepared in 10 litre glass or plastic bottles with screw-threaded stoppers.

**Final products: Formulation 1**
{:.keep-with-next}
Final concentrations:

*	Ethanol 80% (v/v)
*	Glycerol 1.45% (v/v)
*	Hydrogen peroxide 0.125% (v/v)

**Final products: Formulation 2**
{:.keep-with-next}
Final concentrations:

*	Isopropyl alcohol 75% (v/v)
*	Glycerol 1.45% (v/v)
*	Hydrogen peroxide 0.125% (v/v)

#### Quality control

1.	Pre-production analysis should be made every time an analysis certificate is not available to guarantee the titration of alcohol (i.e. local production). Verify the alcohol concentration with the alcoholmeter and make the necessary adjustments in volume in the preparation formulation to obtain the final recommended concentration.
2.	Post-production analysis is mandatory if either ethanol or an isopropanol solution is used. Use the alcoholmeter to control the alcohol concentration of the final use solution. The accepted limits should be fixed to +- 5% of the target concentration (75%-85% for ethanol).
