# About the book

This book is part of the Bettercare series which addresses the need for continuing education and for health professionals. The book is produced under the auspices of the Infection Control Africa Network (ICAN), to assist with training of healthcare workers during the current Ebola virus disease outbreak. However, the infection control principles discussed in the book are applicable to management of other viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks. The book should be used both by healthcare workers, institutions and Ministries of Health dealing with the Ebola outbreak in west Africa. The book should also be of value to institutions wanting to increase their level of Ebola-preparedness.

Funding for the development of this book was generously provided by the Stellenbosch Uni-versity Rural Medical Education Partnership Initiative (SURMEPI) project. SURMEPI is funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR) through HRSA under the term T84HA21652. We gratefully acknowledge the input of many colleagues worldwide who have been directly or indirectly involved with the West African Ebola outbreak, who helped to ensure the content of the book is factual and useful in the current Ebola outbreak context. All royalties from the sale of this book will be donated to the Infection Control Africa Network (ICAN).
