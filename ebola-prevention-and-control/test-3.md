# Test 3: Protection of Healthcare Workers

1.	Can healthcare workers in an Ebola Treatment Unit become infected by indirect contact with contaminated equipment or surfaces?
	-	Not with Ebola
	-	Only if the contaminated object touches the healthcare workerâ€™s mouth
	-	Only if the equipment or surface is wet
	+	Yes as indirect contact is a method of spreading Ebola
2.	What are standard precautions?
	+	Actions which should be applied to all patients whether they are thought to be infectious or not
	-	Precautions taken only if a patient is thought to have an infectious disease
	-	Special precautions taken when caring for Ebola patients
	-	Special precautions taken when burying someone who has died of Ebola
3.	Transmission-based precautions in an Ebola outbreak:
	-	Are not needed if standard precautions are applied
	+	Are needed in addition to standard precautions
	-	Are only needed when patients are transported
	-	Are only needed when moving corpses
4.	When caring for an Ebola patient:
	-	Airborne precautions are needed
	+	Droplet precautions are needed
	-	Both droplet and airborne precautions are needed
	-	Only direct contact precautions are needed
5.	Hand hygiene includes:
	+	Any activity that reduces the number of microorganisms on the hands
	-	Handwashing only
	-	Alcohol handrub only
	-	Surgical scrub only
6.	When using an alcohol handrub for hand hygiene:
	-	It should contain 20 to 30% alcohol
	-	Dry the hands with a paper towel immediately afterwards
	+	Allow the hands to remain wet for at least 15 seconds
	-	There is no need for added moisturising agents to protect the skin
7.	Alcohol-based handrub is a very effective method of hand hygiene if:
	-	The hands are visibly soiled (dirt, blood or body fluids)
	+	The hands are not visibly soiled
	-	The hands are well washed with soap and water afterwards
	-	The hands are well washed with a detergent after the handrub
8.	What are the 'WHO Five moments for Hand Hygiene'?
	-	The 5 organisations which promote good hand hygiene
	+	The 5 times when hand hygiene is important
	-	The 5 methods that can be used to provide hand hygiene
	-	The 5 steps that should be followed when hands are washed correctly
9.	Is a solution of 0.05% chlorine suitable for routine hand hygiene?
	-	Yes as it is more effective than handwashing
	-	Yes as it needs a short contact time with the skin
	-	No as it is very expensive
	+	No as it can irritate and damage the skin
10.	What personal protective equipment is needed when taking a blood sample from an Ebola patient?
	+	The protective equipment must ensure that no skin is left uncovered
	-	A mask and gloves are adequate
	-	A mask and double gloves are adequate
	-	A mask, goggles and double gloves are adequate
11.	What types of eye protection are recommended when caring for Ebola patients?
	-	Eye protection is not needed if the patient is not coughing
	-	Ordinary reading glasses are adequate
	+	Goggles or face shields can be used
	-	Only a face-shield is suitable
12.	What is the role of a face mask when examining a patient with Ebola?
	+	It reduces the risk of splashes or droplets reaching the mouth and nose
	-	It prevents airborne spread of Ebola virus
	-	It prevents the healthcare worker breathing on the patient and possibly spreading influenza virus
	-	It prevents the patient identifying the healthcare worker
13.	What type of head cover is recommended when managing Ebola patients?
	-	A cotton surgical cap
	-	A surgical cap, goggles and face mask
	+	A balaclava or head cover that covers most of the head and neck
	-	Head cover is not needed if goggles and a face mask are worn
14.	When wearing personal protective equipment:
	+	Both a gown and apron are needed
	-	A gown alone is adequate
	-	An apron over working clothes is adequate
	-	Neither a gown nor apron are needed if the working clothes are well washed after going off duty
15.	What benefits are there from wearing gloves when touching an Ebola patient?
	-	Gloves can be used instead of having to wash hands
	+	Gloves help protect during both direct and indirect contact
	-	Gloves help protect the hands from disinfectants
	-	Gloves keep the hands cool in a hot environment
16.	What is the meaning of donning personal protective equipment?
	-	Choosing the correct size of protective equipment
	-	Cleaning the protective equipment after use
	+	Putting the protective equipment on
	-	Taking the protective equipment off
17.	The main role of a 'PPE buddy' is to:
	-	Collect the used personal protective clothing and safely dispose of it 
	-	Provide emotional support when caring for Ebola patients
	+	Helping with putting on and taking off personal protective clothing
	-	Notifying your family if you become infected with Ebola
18.	In which order (sequence) should protective clothing be taken off?
	-	Usually the boots are removed first
	-	The outer gloves can be taken off first
	-	The head cover and eye protection should be taken off last
	+	The second pair of gloves should be removed last
19.	If personal protective equipment is not available:
	-	Ordinary clothing is adequate if the person is careful to avoid splashes of body fluid
	-	Handwashing alone will prevent most infections
	+	Every available precaution should still be used such as plastic bags in place of gloves
	-	Under no circumstance should they provide care for an Ebola patient
20.	Healthcare workers who have been caring for Ebola patients can safely use public transport, attend mass gatherings and return to routine work after:
	+	A 21 day post-exposure period
	-	A 15 day post-exposure period
	-	A 7 day post-exposure period
	-	A 48 hour post-exposure period
