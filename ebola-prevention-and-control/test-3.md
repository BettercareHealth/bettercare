9.	Is a solution of 0.05% chlorine suitable for routine hand hygiene?
	1.	Yes as it is more effective than hand washing
	1.	Yes as it needs a short contact time with the skin
	1.	No as it is very expensive
	1.	No as it can irritate and damage the skin
10.	What personal protective equipment is needed when taking a blood sample from an Ebola patient?
	1.	The protective equipment must ensure that no skin is left uncovered
	1.	A mask and gloves are adequate

	1.	A mask, goggles and double gloves are adequate
11.	What types of eye protection are recommended when caring for Ebola patients?
	1.	Eye protection is not needed if the patient is not coughing
	1.	Ordinary reading glasses are adequate
	1.	Goggles or faceshields can be used
	1.	Only a face-shield is suitable
12.	What is the role of a face mask when examining a patient with Ebola?
	1.	It reduces the risk of splashes or droplets reaching the mouth and nose
	1.	It prevents airborne spread of Ebola virus
	1.	It prevents the healthcare worker breathing on the patient and possibly spreading influenza virus
	1.	It prevents the patient identifying the healthcare worker
13.	What type of head cover is recommended when managing Ebola patients?
	1.	A cotton surgical cap
