# Test 1: Virology and Epidemiology

1.	What is Ebola?
	-	A country in Central Africa
	+	A common name for Ebola virus disease
	-	A form of malaria recently discovered in West Africa
	-	A serious disease spread by lice
2.	What do viruses need to survive and multiply?
	+	A host cell
	-	Red blood cells
	-	Blood agar culture medium
	-	A culture solution rich in glucose
3.	Viral haemorrhagic fevers include:
	-	Malaria
	-	Typhoid
	-	Rheumatic fever
	+	Marburg fever
4.	Congo fever virus can be transmitted to humans by:
	-	Mosquitoes
	-	Bites by a bat
	+	Ticks
	-	Lice
5.	Eating bushmeat is an important source of:
	+	Ebola
	-	Yellow fever
	-	Dengue fever
	-	Lassa fever
6.	Touching or washing corpses in a traditional ceremony may be responsible for spreading:
	-	Rift valley fever
	-	Chikungunya fever
	+	Ebola
	-	Crimean fever
7.	What is the incubation period of Ebola?
	-	2 to 5 days
	-	2 to 7 days
	+	2 to 21 days
	-	2 to 40 days
8.	Which body fluids may contain Ebola virus?
	-	Blood only
	-	Vomitus and diarrhoea stool only
	-	Semen and vaginal secretions only
	+	All body fluids
9.	Ebola is infectious:
	-	Throughout the incubation period
	+	When the patient is clinically ill
	-	Only when the patient starts to bleed
	-	During the 21 days after the patient has clinically recovered
10.	Ebola virus may be transmitted:
	+	By contact with a personâ€™s mucous membranes
	-	By droplet spread when coughing
	-	By direct contact with intact skin
	-	Sexually for a year after the illness
11.	Ebola was first described:
	-	In ancient Greece
	-	In South Africa in 1953
	+	In the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976
	-	In Sierra Leone in 2004
12.	One of the countries most affected with Ebola during the current outbreak is:
	-	Sudan
	-	Tanzania
	-	Senegal
	+	Liberia
13.	Why are there so many infected cases in the current outbreak of Ebola?
	-	Because the climate is hot and damp
	+	Because of overcrowding in urban areas
	-	Because of poor hygiene in rural areas
	-	Because of poor mosquito control measures
14.	The risk of a healthcare worker becoming infected with Ebola virus:
	-	Is the same as the general population
	-	Is low if they wash their hands well after touching a patient with Ebola
	+	Is high if they do not use standard precautions correctly
	-	Is so high that it is best if the family care for the patient
15.	The most important principle in investigating a case of suspected Ebola is to:
	-	Get as many laboratory investigations as possible
	+	Only do essential investigations
	-	Choose the cheapest investigations
	-	Avoid taking a blood sample as the patient may start bleeding severely
16.	What is a bio-safety laboratory?
	-	A small mobile laboratory in the tropical forest
	-	A fully automated laboratory that does not need laboratory staff
	+	A laboratory with maximum safety features
	-	A standard hospital laboratory
17.	What laboratory test can be used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of Ebola?
	+	ELISA or PCR
	-	Standard light microscopy
	-	A skin test
	-	A full blood count and liver function tests
18.	What laboratory tests are useful to detect other diseases which may be confused with Ebola?
	-	Throat swab and viral culture for influenza
	-	Serum bilirubin and packed cell volume for yellow fever
	+	Malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and smear
	-	Blood culture for Marburg fever
19.	How should a laboratory specimen be transported?
	-	The information form should be wrapped tightly around the test tube
	+	The test tube should be placed in a screw-top container and then another container such as a leak-proof plastic box with a secure lid
	-	The test tube should be placed in an open container of ice
	-	No special precautions are needed
20.	How can a laboratory specimen be safely processed?
	-	It should be centrifuged first to decontaminate it
	-	The test tube containing the specimen should be passed through a flame a few times to kill the virus
	-	A few drops of chlorine should be added to the specimen as soon as it is opened
	+	Full personal protective equipment should be worn when handling the specimen
