	1.	Lice
5.	Eating bushmeat is an important source of:
	1.	Ebola
	1.	Yellow fever
	1.	Dengue fever
	1.	Lassa fever
6.	Touching or washing corpses in a traditional ceremony may be responsible for spreading:
	1.	Rift valley fever
	1.	Chikungunya fever
	1.	Ebola
	1.	Crimean fever
7.	What is the incubation period of Ebola?
	1.	2 to 5 days
	1.	2 to 7 days
	1.	2 to 21 days
	1.	2 to 40 days
8.	Which body fluids may contain Ebola virus?
	1.	Blood only
	1.	Vomitus and diarrhoea stool only
	1.	Semen and vaginal secretions only
	1.	All body fluids
9.	Ebola is infectious:
	1.	Throughout the incubation period
	1.	When the patient is clinically ill
	1.	Only when the patient starts to bleed
	1.	During the 21 days after the patient has clinically recovered
10.	Ebola virus may be transmitted:
	1.	By contact with a personâ€™s mucous membranes
	1.	By droplet spread when coughing
	1.	By direct contact with intact skin
	1.	Sexually for a year after the illness
11.	Ebola was first described:
	1.	In ancient Greece
	1.	In South Africa in 1953
	1.	In the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976
	1.	In Sierra Leone in 2004

	1.	Sudan
	1.	Tanzania
	1.	Senegal
	1.	Liberia
13.	Why are there so many infected cases in the current outbreak of Ebola?
	1.	Because the climate is hot and damp
	1.	Because of overcrowding in urban areas
	1.	Because of poor hygiene in rural areas
	1.	Because of poor mosquito control measures
14.	The risk of a healthcare worker becoming infected with Ebola virus:
	1.	Is the same as the general population
	1.	Is low if they wash their hands well after touching a patient with Ebola
	1.	Is high if they do not use standard precautions correctly
	1.	Is so high that it is best if the family care for the patient
15.	The most important principle in investigating a case of suspected Ebola is to:
	1.	Get as many laboratory investigations as possible
	1.	Only do essential investigations
	1.	Choose the cheapest investigations
	1.	Avoid taking a blood sample as the patient may start bleeding severely
16.	What is a bio-safety laboratory?
	1.	A small mobile laboratory in the tropical forest
	1.	A fully automated laboratory that does not need laboratory staff
	1.	A laboratory with maximum safety features
	1.	A standard hospital laboratory
17.	What laboratory test can be used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of Ebola?
	1.	ELISA or PCR
	1.	Standard light microscopy
	1.	A skin test
	1.	A full blood count and liver function tests
18.	What laboratory tests are useful to detect other diseases which may be confused with Ebola?

	1.	Serum bilirubin and packed cell volume for yellow fever
	1.	Malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and smear
	1.	Blood culture for Marburg fever
19.	How should a laboratory specimen be transported?
	1.	The information form should be wrapped tightly around the test tube
	1.	The test tube should be placed in a screw-top container and then another container such as a leak proof plastic box with a secure lid
	1.	The test tube should be placed in an open container of ice
	1.	No special precautions are needed
20.	How can a laboratory specimen be safely processed?
	1.	It should be centrifuged first to decontaminate it
	1.	The test tube containing the specimen should be passed through a flame a few times to kill the virus
	1.	A few drops of chlorine should be added to the specimen as soon as it is opened
	1.	Full personal protective equipment should be worn when handling the specimen
