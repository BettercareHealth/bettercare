	-	To remove the breast as this will always cure the cancer
2.	What types of local management are available?
	+	Surgery
	-	Chemotherapy
	-	Hormone therapy
	-	Targeted therapy
3.	What does neoadjuvant therapy mean?
	-	A new form of therapy is used
	+	Systemic therapy is given before surgery
	-	Radiotherapy is given after chemotherapy
	-	Hormone therapy is used on its own
4.	Adjuvant therapy is given:
	-	Instead of surgery
	-	Before surgery
	-	During surgery
	+	After surgery
5.	With a wide local excision:
	-	Both breasts are removed
	-	Radical mastectomy is done
	+	The cancer with a margin of normal tissue around it is removed
	-	Only the lump is removed
6.	What is a simple mastectomy?
	+	All the breast tissue is removed but not the local lymph nodes
	-	Both the breast tissue and the local lymph nodes are removed
	-	Only the lump and the nipple are removed
	-	Only a segment of the breast is removed
7.	When can a breast reconstruction be done?
	-	It cannot be done at the same time as the surgery to remove the cancer
	+	It can be immediate or delayed
	-	It always needs to be delayed so that the skin can be stretched first
	-	It should be delayed for 3 months so that the wound can heal first
8.	Important complications of removing the axillary lymph nodes include:
	-	Weakness of the arm
	+	Swelling of the arm
	-	Swelling of the chest
	-	Weakness of the hand
9.	What is a sentinel lymph node biopsy?
	+	The lymph nodes closest to the breast are removed
	-	The lymph nodes furthest from the breast are removed
	-	The lymph nodes in the neck are removed
	-	All the lymph nodes in the axilla are removed
10.	Chemotherapy is usually given:
	-	At the same time as surgery
	-	Instead of surgery for stage 1 breast cancer
	-	For curative but not palliative care
	+	When the cancer has been surgically removed but there is a high risk of recurrence
11.	Who should make the decision whether adjuvant chemotherapy should be given or not?
	+	A multidisciplinary team
	-	The surgeon alone
	-	The radiotherapist alone
	-	The oncologist alone
12.	Who should be offered neoadjuvant therapy?
	-	Women who need palliative care only
	-	Women who have a high risk of cancer in the other breast
	+	Women with an inflammatory carcinoma
	-	Women with ductal carcinoma in situ
13.	Hormone therapy should be given if:
	+	The cancer cells are ER +ve
	-	The cancer cells are ER −ve
	-	The cancer cells are HER2 +ve
	-	The hormonal status of the cells is unknown
14.	Which drug blocks estrogen receptors?
	-	Goserelin
	+	Tamoxifen
	-	Cyclophosphamide
	-	Progesterone
15.	Aromatase inhibitors block:
	-	Progesterone production from the ovaries
	+	Estrogen production from other hormones in postmenopausal women
	-	Estrogen receptors on breast cancer cells in premenopausal women
	-	Androgen production in the adrenal glands
16.	Hormone therapy should be given:
	-	For 6 weeks
	-	For 6 months
	-	For a year
	+	For at least 5 years
17.	What is an example of targeted therapy?
	-	Surgery when the lump is identified by ultrasound
	-	Choice of the most suitable chemotherapy
	+	Treatment with Herceptin
	-	Radiotherapy after marking the area on the skin
18.	Adjuvant radiotherapy is usually given after:
	-	Six weeks of treatment with Raloxifene
	-	Modified radical mastectomy
	-	Palliative chemotherapy
	+	Wide local excision
19.	Adjuvant radiotherapy is usually given:
	+	Six weeks after surgery
	-	To pregnant women with breast cancer
	-	Before chemotherapy is started
	-	If the woman has been treated previously with radiotherapy for a lymphoma
20.	Therapeutic radiotherapy is given:
