# Preface

This book is part of the Bettercare series, which addresses the need for continuing education of healthcare workers. The series was founded by Prof Woods and has been extensively used in South Africa. The book was inspired by the Breast Course for Nurses that has been run by Dr Edge at Christiaan Barnard Hospital in Cape Town. If you are interested in signing up for the course, please visit the website [www.breastcourse4nurses.co.za](http://www.breastcourse4nurses.co.za).

We have had great fun writing the book. As can be seen from the page of acknowledgements, it was truly a collaborative effort. We hope you learn as much from using the book as we did from writing it.
