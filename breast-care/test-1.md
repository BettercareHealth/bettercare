# Test 1: The normal breast

1.	What is the breast line?
	+	A line from the armpit to the groin where breasts can develop
	-	A blue line which is commonly seen around the areola in young girls
	-	A line between the two nipples which indicates where to apply heart massage in infants who do not breathe by themselves after delivery
	-	A line to assess whether breasts are drooping in older women
2.	What are breasts like in most normal infants at birth?
	-	Usually the breasts are very small and any breast development is abnormal
	-	The breasts cannot develop as newborn infants do not produce sex hormones
	-	Only female infants may develop swollen breasts after birth
	+	A small lump (a breast bud) can usually be felt under the nipple
3.	During puberty:
	-	The rate of breast development is always the same in both breasts so that both breasts are the same size
	+	One breast larger than the other (asymmetrical breasts) is common
	-	The right breast always starts to develop first
	-	One breast larger than the other (asymmetrical breast development) is abnormal
4.	The nipple-areola complex (NAC):
	+	Is normal and consists of the nipple and surrounding areola
	-	Is a common emotional problem in adolescent girls
	-	Is a form of eczema which needs treatment
	-	Is an early sign of breast malignancy
5.	What is the function of the lobes in the breast?
	-	They produce estrogen
	+	They produce milk
	-	They determine the size and shape of the breast during puberty
	-	They attach the breast to the chest wall
6.	The size of the breasts in a woman who is not breastfeeding is mostly dependent on:
	-	The size of the muscles under the breasts
	-	The size of the lobes
	-	The number of the lobes
	+	The amount of supportive and fatty tissue
7.	Where do most breast lymphaticâ€™s drain to?
	-	The neck
	-	The abdomen
	+	The armpit (axilla)
	-	The chest
8.	During the menstrual cycle:
	+	If a woman has normal lumpy breasts these lumps increase in size before the start of the period
	-	The lumps get bigger during the period
	-	The lumps get bigger during the week after the period
	-	The size of the lumps do not change with the menstrual cycle
9.	What breast changes occur during pregnancy?
	-	There are very few changes in women who have small breasts
	+	Breast tenderness is common early in pregnancy
	-	Colostrum is only produced after delivery
	-	Breast changes occur earlier if the fetus is female
10.	How do breasts change in older women?
	-	They become smaller because the ducts disappear
	-	They become harder as fatty tissue is lost
	+	They become softer with an increase in fatty tissue
	-	They only change and hang down more if the woman had breastfed her infants
11.	What are aberrations of normal development and involution (ANDI)?
	-	Early signs of breast cancer
	+	Common variations of normal which may result in the formation of lumps
	-	Common problems seen during childhood
	-	They are not common and of no clinical importance
12.	What breast changes are common in women between 15 and 25 years of age?
	-	Cyst formation
	-	Bleeding from one or both nipples
	+	Fibroadenomas
	-	Duct ectasia
13.	What is a sign of a fibroadenoma?
	-	Painful breast lump
	+	Painless breast lump
	-	Nipple discharge
	-	Nipple inversion
14.	Fibroadenomas are due to:
	-	The use of oral contraceptives
	-	Use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
	+	Excessive lobe development
	-	Pregnancy

	-	Fibroadenomas
	-	Pigmentation changes in the nipple-areola complex
	-	Both nipples become inverted
18.	The typical clinical finding of a breast cyst is:
	-	A watery nipple discharge
	-	Nipple inversion
	-	Redness of the overlying skin
