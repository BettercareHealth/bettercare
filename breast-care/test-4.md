	*	Abnormal deep inflammation
	*	Aberrations of normal development and involution
	*	Aggressive necrotizing disseminated infection
2.	What does benign mean?
	*	It only occurs in older people
	*	It will get better without treatment
	*	It cannot be detected on physical examination
	*	It is not malignant
3.	What is a common cause of a benign breast lump?
	*	Cancer
	*	A cyst
	*	Fat necrosis due to trauma
	*	Pregnancy
4.	Who usually gets fibroadenomas?
	*	Young women under the age of 35 years
	*	Children before the age of puberty
	*	Older women between 35 and 50 years
	*	Women after menopause
5.	What does a fibroadenoma feel like on examination?
	*	It is soft
	*	It is hard and fixed to the skin
	*	It is lumpy and the edge is difficult to feel
	*	It is firm, round and moves around under your fingers
6.	What tends to happen to fibroadenomas if they are not removed?
	*	They rapidly grow bigger
	*	They grow in size from 1 to 3 cm then stay that size
	*	They steadily become smaller over a few weeks
	*	They rapidly multiply into many small fibroadenomas
7.	Are fibroadenomas associated with an increased risk of cancer?
	*	Fibroadenomas are easy to diagnose and are not associated with breast cancer
	*	There is a slightly increased risk of cancer if a fibroadenoma develops in older women
	*	There is a high risk of a fibroadenoma becoming malignant in younger women
	*	Most fibroadenomas will become malignant over time
8.	What causes breast cysts?
	*	Eating raw meat containing tape worm eggs
	*	Previous bruising due to trauma
	*	Shrinkage of the lobes of the breast
	*	Previous breastfeeding
9.	Breast cysts usually present in:
	*	Early adolescence
	*	Young women before their first pregnancy
	*	Mature women between 25 and 35 years
	*	Women over the age of 40 years
10.	Which breast cysts should be drained?
	*	Cysts which are easily palpable on examination
	*	All breast cysts especially if they are small and only found on a mammogram
	*	Only cysts which are painful and present during pregnancy
	*	There is no need to drain breast cysts as they are never malignant
11.	What is mastalgia?
	*	Very large breasts in a young woman
	*	A breast infection caused by *Staphylococcus*
	*	Breast pain and tenderness which is worse before, and much better after, a menstrual period
	*	A particularly aggressive form of breast cancer
12.	How should mastalgia be treated?
	*	Mastectomy
	*	Hormone replacement therapy
	*	Apply steroid cream
	*	Buy a well-fitted bra
13.	What is ductal ectasia?
	*	Dilatation of the ducts under the nipple as part of the normal ageing process
	*	A common cause of bleeding from both nipples during breastfeeding
	*	A form of early cancer which has not yet spread beyond the ducts
	*	A common cause of breast pain in young women
14.	Periductal mastitis can result in:
	*	Cancer
	*	Severe breast pain and swelling
	*	Enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit
	*	An inverted nipple
15.	What investigation should be done if a woman has ductal ectasia or periductal mastitis?
	*	Any nipple discharge should be cultured so that the correct antibiotic can be chosen
	*	All women over 40 years should have a mammogram
	*	The affected area should be biopsied to exclude tuberculosis
	*	No investigations are needed as complications are uncommon
16.	Paget’s disease:
	*	Is a benign condition due to involution of the breast in older women
	*	Looks like eczema of the nipple and is a sign of breast cancer
	*	Is a rare form of breast lump caused by leprosy
	*	Presents as a keratin pearl on the nipple and needs no treatment
17.	A biopsy of the nipple or areola:
	*	Is usually done with a Tru-cut needle
	*	Is done under local anaesthetic with a punch biopsy tool
	*	Is best done by a surgeon under general anaesthetic
	*	Can be done with a fine needle aspiration
18.	When should a nipple discharge be investigated?
	*	If it is bloody
	*	If there is a small amount of green discharge from one nipple
	*	If it is milky and from both breasts during late pregnancy
	*	If a little thick discharge can be squeezed out of a nipple
19.	What is a common cause of a greenish nipple discharge?
	*	Cancer
	*	Paget’s disease of the nipple
	*	Duct ectasia
	*	Fibroadenomas
20.	Can breast cancer present like an infection?
	*	No, as breast cancer is not caused by an infection
	*	Breast cancer is more likely if the woman had nipple infection during her pregnancies
	*	Breast cancer is more likely if the woman has had a breast abscess before
	*	Inflammatory breast cancer can mimic a breast infection
