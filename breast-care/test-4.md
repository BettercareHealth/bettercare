	+	Aberrations of normal development and involution
	-	Aggressive necrotizing disseminated infection
2.	What does benign mean?
	-	It only occurs in older people
	-	It will get better without treatment
	-	It cannot be detected on physical examination
	+	It is not malignant
3.	What is a common cause of a benign breast lump?

	-	They rapidly grow bigger
	+	They grow in size from 1 to 3 cm then stay that size
	-	They steadily become smaller over a few weeks
	-	They rapidly multiply into many small fibroadenomas
7.	Are fibroadenomas associated with an increased risk of cancer?
	-	Fibroadenomas are easy to diagnose and are not associated with breast cancer
	+	There is a slightly increased risk of cancer if a fibroadenoma develops in older women
	-	There is a high risk of a fibroadenoma becoming malignant in younger women
	-	Most fibroadenomas will become malignant over time
8.	What causes breast cysts?
	-	Eating raw meat containing tape worm eggs

11.	What is mastalgia?

	-	Mastectomy
	-	Hormone replacement therapy
	-	Apply steroid cream
	+	Buy a well-fitted bra
13.	What is ductal ectasia?
	+	Dilatation of the ducts under the nipple as part of the normal ageing process
	-	A common cause of bleeding from both nipples during breastfeeding
	-	A form of early cancer which has not yet spread beyond the ducts
	-	A common cause of breast pain in young women
14.	Periductal mastitis can result in:
	-	Cancer
	-	Severe breast pain and swelling
	-	Enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit
	+	An inverted nipple
15.	What investigation should be done if a woman has ductal ectasia or periductal mastitis?
	-	Any nipple discharge should be cultured so that the correct antibiotic can be chosen
	+	All women over 40 years should have a mammogram
	-	The affected area should be biopsied to exclude tuberculosis
	-	No investigations are needed as complications are uncommon
16.	Paget’s disease:
	-	Is a benign condition due to involution of the breast in older women
	+	Looks like eczema of the nipple and is a sign of breast cancer
	-	Is a rare form of breast lump caused by leprosy
	-	Presents as a keratin pearl on the nipple and needs no treatment
17.	A biopsy of the nipple or areola:
	-	Is usually done with a Tru-cut needle

	-	Cancer
	-	Paget’s disease of the nipple
	+	Duct ectasia
	-	Fibroadenomas
20.	Can breast cancer present like an infection?
	-	No, as breast cancer is not caused by an infection

	-	Breast cancer is more likely if the woman has had a breast abscess before
	+	Inflammatory breast cancer can mimic a breast infection
