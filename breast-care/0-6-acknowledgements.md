# Acknowledgements

This book would not have been written without the input of many people. It was based on breast care courses that have been taught at Christiaan Barnard Memorial Hospital (CBMH), Cape Town over a couple of years. Although the chapters were written by David Woods and Jenny Edge, they were based on material supplied by different contributors – experts in their fields. Other chapters were edited by different individuals.

The whole book was reviewed by Dr Ines Buccimaza, Dr Herbert Cubash, Sr Riatha van As and Prof Jimmy Volmink.

The beautiful illustrations were drawn by Ms Fiona Gawronsky. The authors would like to thank her for her patience and dedication.

The chapters were edited by the following people:

Chapter 1: Dr Ines Buccimaza

Chapter 2: Dr Ines Buccimaza

Chapter 3: Dr Tom Dicker and Dr Judy Whittaker

Chapter 4: Prof Eugenio Panieri, Dr Ronelle de Villiers, Dr Herbert Cubash

Chapter 5: Prof Eugenio Panieri, Dr Miriam Mutebi, Dr Irene Boeddinghaus

Chapter 6: Prof Eugenio Panieri, Dr Jacqui Hall, Dr Greg Hart, Dr Irene Boeddinghaus, Dr Nola Lloyd, Prof Dudley Werner

Chapter 7: Dr Irene Boeddinghaus, Dr Greg Hart and Dr Jacqui Hall. The lymphoedema section was edited by Sr Colleen Marco, Ms Carola Schoonheim and Ms Isla Muhl and Ms Sue Serebro.

Chapter 8: Dr Liz Gwyther, Sr Yvonne Jackman

Chapter 9: Dr Murray Rushmere, Ms Linda Greeff, Mr Brett Kuyper

The multiple-choice questions were edited by Sr Lieske Wegelin. Sr Sheila Correia and Sr Karen Hill have given their feedback. The cover photograph was taken by Deryck van Steenderen: the three models were Amanda Strydom, Mandisa Nangu and Gadija Orrie. 

The management team (Mr Chris Tilney, Sr Vanessa Cilliers and Michelle Norris) from CBMH, Cape Town, have been generous with their support for this project. Mr Ian Black, CEC Carecross, was one of the first to express enthusiasm for the project.

A significant contribution to the book came from Mr Brett Kuyper who painstakingly phoned all the listed NGOs working in the breast care sector in South Africa. At the time of publication, the contact details were correct. He also read through all the chapters and made many corrections and asked for expanded explanations for areas that were not clear.

Finally, we would like to thank our spouses, Sarah and Tony, for their support.
