# The normal breast

## Objectives

When you have completed this module you should be able to:

*	Describe the appearance and anatomy of a normal breast.
*	Describe the normal developmental changes that happen to the breast after birth, during puberty and pregnancy and in the elderly.
*	Understand that lumps and changes in the breast may be normal.

## Case study 1

A worried mother brings her 11 year old daughter to a clinic complaining that she has noticed a hard lump behind her one nipple. There is nothing abnormal to be felt on the other side. The mother wants to know whether the child’s breast is normal, as she has had breast cancer.

1.	Should the mother be concerned that her daughter has a lump under one nipple?
2.	Is it normal to get a breast lump on one side only?
3.	Does it mean she will always have one breast bigger than the other?
4.	Would you be more worried if the daughter’s breast lump was painful?

## Case study 2

A woman of 22 years of age complains of painful breasts every month before her period. She has also noticed a number of lumps in both her breasts. She has always had inverted nipples.

1.	Is it common to have painful breasts?
2.	Would you be worried about her inverted nipples?
3.	What is the commonest cause of multiple breast lumps in a young woman?
4.	What is ANDI?
5.	At what age do fibroadenomas usually occur?

## Case study 3

A woman of 25 years presents 3 months after the birth of her baby. She did not breastfeed. Her complaint is that her breasts have become softer and have changed shape.

1.	What normal changes take place in a woman’s breasts early in pregnancy?
2.	What breast changes can be expected after pregnancy and breastfeeding?
3.	Can these changes be prevented if the mother chooses not to breastfeed?
4.	What further breast changes are likely to occur as she becomes older?

## Normal breast appearance

### 1-1 What is a breast?

Breasts are specially modified glands in the skin and are present in all infants at birth. Breast size in the fetus increases as the pregnancy progresses. Therefore the breasts may be very small in preterm infants.

Usually one breast is present on either side of the chest. However, one or more accessory (extra) nipples or breasts may be present along the ‘breast line’ from the armpit down to the groin. Many animals such as dogs have a number of breasts along this line.

Note
:	Breasts or mammary glands are present in all mammals.

### 1-2 What are breasts normally like at birth?

In infants born at term the nipple and areola are well developed and a small lump called a breast bud can be felt under the nipple. The areola is the pink area around the nipple. The breast bud consists of glandular tissue which has grown due to the presence of sex hormones in the fetus. The appearance of the breasts and the presence of breast buds are the same in boys and girls.

> Slightly enlarged breasts in newborn infants are normal

### 1-3 Do the breasts change during the first months of life?

Yes. During the first months after birth one or both breast buds may enlarge further for a few weeks and may even produce small amounts of milk. These normal changes in the breasts are due to sex hormones produced by the infant. After a few months sex hormones are no longer produced and the breast bud disappears.

Do not try to express milk as this may result in infection of the breast.

Note
:	In the normal fetus and newborn infant sex hormones are produced by the ovaries, testes and adrenals.

### 1-4 What happens to breasts during puberty?

At about 10 years of age the female child’s ovaries start to produce the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. This is called puberty. The sex hormones cause the breast to start developing with enlargement of the nipple and areola. A breast bud develops below the nipple and areola. These normal changes usually occur in both breasts at the same time. It is common for breast buds to be tender.

### 1-5 Is it abnormal if one breast starts to develop faster than the other?

No. One breast bud may start to develop first so that the breasts are of different sizes (they are asymmetrical). This is normal and common. With time both breasts will increase in size normally. There is no need to worry about the breast lump being malignant as breast cancer does not develop in girls during puberty.

Asymmetrical breasts are common during puberty.

### 1-6 When is breast development at puberty complete?

Usually breasts reach their normal shape by about 18 years of age. Some individuals have larger breasts than others. Breast size usually follows a trend in the family.

### 1-7 Are a woman’s breasts usually both the same size?

More than 50% of women have one breast that appears slightly larger than the other. This mild asymmetry is normal.

### 1-8 What happens to breast appearance in early adulthood?

The breasts may continue to enlarge and start to droop even if the woman is not pregnant. This change in breast size and shape is normal.

Normal breast anatomy

### 1-9 What is the shape of the normal breast?

The breast is shaped like a pear and the tail of breast tissue extends under the arm. Some women have breast tissue that can be felt in the armpit. This may be more noticeable during pregnancy.

### 1-10 What is the structure of the normal breast?

The breast consists of:

*	The nipple
*	The areola
*	About 10 or more lobes
*	Supportive and fatty tissue

### 1-11 What is the appearance of a normal nipple and areola?

The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is made up of the nipple, which usually sticks out, and the surrounding pigmented areola. Under the skin of the areola is a circle of muscle which contracts when the nipple or areola is touched. The areola has sweat glands which can be seen as slightly raised pale dots.

Note
:	Circular muscle fibres surround the nipple. It is normal to have small nodules on the areola which are the openings of Montgomery’s tubercles.

> The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is made up of both the nipple and surrounding areola.

### 1-12 What is the function of the lobes?

The lobes (made up of many lobules) are glandular structures. The major lobes drain into ducts which open onto the nipple. During pregnancy (and in newborn infants) the lobes produce milk.

### 1-13 Why is the supportive and fatty tissue in the breast important?

The supportive tissue helps to give the breast its shape while the amount of fatty tissue determines the size of the breast. Both the supportive and fatty tissue (stroma) is found around the lobes. The amount of supportive and fatty tissue varies enormously between individuals.

The basic anatomy of the male breast is the same as that in the female breast but the breasts usually do not enlarge during puberty.

Note
:	Breast enlargement during puberty in males is called gynaecomastia. This can cause embarrassment but usually resolves within a few months without any treatment. It commonly occurs in only one breast.

### 1-14 Why is the lymphatic drainage of the breasts important?

All organs in the body use both the blood and the lymphatic systems to drain fluid from the tissues. In this way the lymphatic system helps to remove unwanted cells and debris (breakdown products). The lymphatics (lymph vessels) drain lymph (tissue fluid) to local lymph nodes which act as sieves and remove abnormal cells which may be either infectious or cancer cells. If a cancer develops in an organ, the next place it will usually spread to is the draining lymph node. The breast generally drains to the lymph nodes in the axilla (armpit) but occasionally may drain to the lymph nodes in the chest. It is therefore important to always feel for axillary lymph nodes when examining a breast.

> All women with a breast complaint should have their armpits examined as well.

### 1-15 How are breasts affected by a woman’s menstrual cycle?

The breasts change with the menstrual cycle as the breasts are influenced by the amount of sex hormones produced. Each month the size of the breast increases until the menstrual period starts. Once the period begins the breasts decrease in size. If a woman has lumpy breasts, the lumps also tend to get bigger before a period. Therefore it is easier to examine a breast after the period has finished and before day 14 of the cycle (i.e. 14 days after the start of the period) when the breasts will again start to enlarge.

### 1-16 How do the breasts change during pregnancy?

During pregnancy the breasts double in size and weight under the influence of large amounts of sex hormones produced by the mother and fetus. The changes start very early in pregnancy and breast enlargement and tenderness may be the first symptom of pregnancy. The size of the lobes increases dramatically. The nipples may stick out more and the areola may get bigger and become more pigmented.

Note
:	The blood flow to the breasts increases and the veins may become more obvious.

> Changes in the breasts with tenderness may be the first symptom of pregnancy.

### 1-17 How do the breasts change during breastfeeding?

Colostrum may be present just before delivery but milk production does not increase until a few days after the infant is born. Milk production continues as long as the infant still breastfeeds. When the infant stops feeding milk production rapidly decreases over a few days.

Note
:	The hormone prolactin results in milk production while the secretion of oxytocin during feeding results in the let down reflex when milk dribbles from both nipples.

### 1-18 What changes are seen after breastfeeding?

The breasts decrease in size and may go back to the size they were before pregnancy but the ducts remain the same. The size depends on how much weight was gained and bigger breasts are due to more fat. The breasts are generally droopier than before pregnancy. The darker nipple and areola will remain.

Small amounts of milk may still be expressed in a woman who is not breastfeeding. 

These changes in breast size and shape are seen after pregnancy even if the woman has not breastfed her infant.

### 1-19 How do the breasts change as a woman becomes older?

After the age of 35 years the breast tissue starts to shrink (involute). The glandular tissue in the lobes starts to become wasted and is initially replaced by fibrous tissue and cysts and later by fat.

Once a woman’s ovaries stop producing sex hormones at about the age of 50 years she goes into menopause. This causes the lobes to decrease in size even more and become replaced by fatty tissue. The breasts tend to become softer and hang down more (drooping or ptotic).

The use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) slows down this ageing process. Generally the breasts get bigger and softer (due to increased fat) as a woman gets older.

> After menopause the breasts become softer.

## Changes in the breast which may be worrying

### 1-20 What normal breast changes may become a problem?

There are a number of normal changes in the breast which are not malignant (cancerous) but can result in the formation of lumps. These changes are referred to as aberrations of normal development and involution or ANDI. These are important as it may be difficult to decide whether changes in a breast are caused by ANDI or serious disease such as cancer.

Note
:	An aberration is not an abnormality, disease or cancer but a variation of normal which can cause symptoms and signs which may be of clinical concern both to women and healthcarers. ANDI is a term used to include most benign breast conditions.

> Aberrations of normal development and involution (ANDI) are common and may cause clinical concern.

### 1-21 How are these normal breast changes best approached?

It is useful to divide women with breast changes into three age categories:

*	Developmental changes that occur during the early years in young women (15 to 25 years)
*	Changes due to menstrual cycle activity that occur during the mature reproductive years (25 to 45 years)
*	Changes that occur during the stage of breast involution (35 to 55 years or beyond in women who are on hormone replacement therapy)

All the changes in these three age categories are caused by hormonal effects in the breasts. As cyclical hormonal changes continue for a longer time during the mature reproductive years, ANDI are most common in these women.

> The normal changes that take place in a woman’s breast are determined by age.

### 1-22 What changes occur in the early years?

*	Fibroadenomas
*	Large breasts
*	Inverted nipples

### 1-23 What are fibroadenomas?

Fibroadenomas (or fibroadenomata) are painless, benign lumps which form due to excessive lobe development. They are usually seen in young women between the ages of 15 and 25 years but can occur in older women. It is uncommon to get a new fibroadenoma after the age of 35 years. Often they form in young women but may not be detected until the breast becomes softer. Fibroadenomas may only be detected when an ultrasound scan or mammogram is done.

Many women have more than one fibroadenoma. They generally grow to 1-2 cm in size. As they are made of breast tissue they will increase or decrease in size as the size of the breast changes. Therefore they may increase in size during pregnancy. Occasionally a fibroadenoma becomes very big (giant fibroadenoma).

A fibroadenoma generally feels smooth and is very mobile.

It is very important to make a correct diagnosis of fibroadenoma as it may feel the same as a breast cancer.

> The correct diagnosis of a fibroadenoma is important as a breast cancer can feel like a fibroadenoma.

### 1-24 When are breasts considered too large?

Breast size depends on the amount of fibrous and fatty tissue. There is a wide variation in adult breast size. What is considered normal also varies between different groups of people. Some breasts continue to grow after puberty and excessive breast size can be a problem and cause dissatisfaction and embarrassment.

### 1-25 What is the appearance of a normal nipple?

There is a wide range of normal nipple shape and size. Shape and colour often change during pregnancy. It is common and can be completely normal to have an inverted (inward turning) nipple. However, it is abnormal if a nipple suddenly becomes inverted as this may be a sign of breast cancer. Eczema of the nipple is also abnormal.

### 1-26 What changes may occur during the mature reproductive years?

The commonest normal change is breast pain (mastalgia) which is usually worse in the days before the period starts.

### 1-27 What changes may occur during the stage of breast involution?

*	Cyst formation
*	Duct ectasia (dilatation of ducts)
*	Nipple inversion

### 1-28 What are breast cysts and when do they occur?

Fluid-filled cysts are common in women between 35 and 55 years old. They usually occur before menopause and are rare after menopause. They may be painful or tender especially before the periods. They feel smooth. Often there is more than one cyst.

### 1-29 What is duct ectasia and when does it occur?

Usually after the menopause. It is caused by dilated ducts below the nipple which may result in a non-bloody nipple discharge or an inverted nipple. The ducts dilate as they approach the nipple. Fluid may leak out of the duct causing scarring behind the nipple and inversion of the nipple. A nipple discharge may be a sign of cancer.

> Both an inverted nipple and nipple discharge may be signs of breast cancer.

## Case study 1

A worried mother brings her 11 year old daughter to a clinic complaining that she has noticed a hard lump behind her one nipple. There is nothing abnormal to be felt on the other side. The mother wants to know whether the child’s breast is normal, as she has had breast cancer.

### 1. Should the mother be concerned that her daughter has a lump under one nipple?

No. A lump under the nipple of a girl aged 11 years is an early sign of puberty.

### 2. Is it normal to get a breast lump on one side only?

Yes. Asymmetrical breast development is very common.

### 3. Does it mean she will always have one breast bigger than the other?

No. Further breast development should be normal. However, many adult women have one breast slightly larger than the other.

### 4. Would you be more worried if the daughter’s breast lump was painful?

No. Normal breast tissue can be painful.

## Case study 2

A woman of 22 years of age complains of painful breasts every month before her period. She has also noticed a number of lumps in both her breasts. She has always had inverted nipples.

### 1. Is it common to have painful breasts?

Painful or tender breasts (mastalgia) is a common complaint in the days before a menstrual period. These symptoms usually disappear once the period begins.

### 2. Would you be worried about her inverted nipples?

No, as they have been present since puberty.

### 3. What is the commonest cause of multiple breast lumps in a young woman?

Fibroadenomas. This condition is an example of ANDI.

### 4. What is ANDI?

Aberrations of normal development and involution. These are common breast changes seen in normal women. They are important as they may cause clinical concern for both the woman and the clinical staff.

### 5. At what age do fibroadenomas usually occur?

Usually between 15 and 25 years of age.

## Case study 3

A woman of 25 years presents 3 months after the birth of her baby. She did not breastfeed. Her complaint is that her breasts have become softer and have changed shape.

### 1. What normal changes take place in a woman’s breasts early in pregnancy?

The breasts enlarge and become tender. These may be the earliest symptoms of pregnancy. Due to high levels of sex hormones the lobes increase in size while the nipple and areola become darker.

### 2. What breast changes can be expected after pregnancy and breastfeeding?

The breasts return to their normal size unless the woman has gained weight. They will become softer and tend to droop.

### 3. Can these changes be prevented if the mother chooses not to breastfeed?

No, as these normal changes will occur even if the woman has not breastfed. 

### 4. What further breast changes are likely to occur as she becomes older?

After the age of 35 years the breast tissue starts to shrink (involute) as the lobes start to become wasted. However, the size of the breasts may increase due to increased fat.

# Clinical assessment of the breast

## Objectives

By the end of this chapter you should be able to 

*	Take a good history when a woman presents with a breast complaint.
*	List the important questions to ask about her breasts.
*	Know how to examine a woman’s breasts.

## Case study 1

A 55 year old woman presents with a painless lump in her breast. She feels the lump is new. On examination, she has a hard mass in the upper outer quadrant of the breast.

1.	With regard to the risk of breast cancer, what are the 3 most important facts given in the history?
2.	Does breast cancer only occur in females?
3.	Why is her age important?
4.	What are the next most important questions to ask?
5.	What specific factors are important to look for in the examination? 
6.	What should you feel for on palpation?

## Case study 2

A young woman of 23 years visits her general practitioner with an upper respiratory infection. While taking a history she mentions that her father’s mother had breast cancer.

1.	Why is a family history of breast cancer important?
2.	Is a history of breast cancer on the father’s side of the family important?
3.	Is it likely that she has breast cancer?
4.	Why is the age at which the family member presented with breast cancer important?
5.	What other cancer in the family will increase the risk of breast cancer?

## Case study 3

A 40 year old woman presents with a bloody nipple discharge from one breast. She is very embarrassed and asks if she can keep her T-shirt on during the examination. The general practitioner, who is in a hurry, agrees and examines her breasts with her lying down. Her armpits are not examined. He only then asks about the discharge but not about her past or family history.

1.	What is the problem with the way the history was taken?
2.	Can you examine a woman’s breast without her undressing?
3.	In what position should the woman be in when her breasts are examined?
4.	How should the armpits (axillae) be examined?
5.	What other lymph nodes should be palpated for?
6.	Where else should be examined?

## History taking

### 2-1 How is a clinical assessment of the breasts performed?

1.	Taking a careful history
2.	Asking important questions
3.	Thoroughly examining the breasts

The purpose of the assessment is to think of the most likely diagnosis of the problem. 

> Always introduce yourself before starting the assessment.

### 2-2 Why is history taking so important?

An accurate history must be taken so that the patient’s risk of having breast cancer can be assessed. The biggest risk factor for developing breast cancer is being female. Breast cancer is rare in males.

> Breast cancer almost always occurs in women.

### 2-3 What history is needed?

*	A family history
*	A past history
*	A present history
*	A general medical history

### 2-4 What is the most important question to ask?

The most important question to ask when taking a history is the age of the woman. The older the woman, the more likely she is to get breast cancer.

> The risk of breast cancer increases with age.

Table 2-1: Risk of breast cancer by age when there is no family history of breast cancer.
{:.table-caption}

| Age (years) | Risk of breast cancer |
|-------------+-----------------------|
| 25          | 1 in 15000            |
| 30          | 1 in 1900             |
| 40          | 1 in 200              |
| 50          | 1 in 50               |
| 60          | 1 in 23               |
| 70          | 1 in 15               |
| 80          | 1 in 11               |
| 85          | 1 in 10               |

The lifetime risk of breast cancer is 1 in 9 in a woman who lives to the age of 80.

> The lifetime risk of breast cancer is 1 in 9 if a woman lives to 80.

### 2-5 What is the importance of a family history when assessing the risk of breast cancer?

A family history is very important. It is essential to ask if anyone in the woman’s family has had breast cancer. If they have, they should be asked at what age did the breast cancer first present (not what age when they died of any cause). All the people with breast cancer in the family should be noted. Ask how many women there are in the family to get an idea of the frequency of any breast cancer. A family history from the father’s side is just as important as from the mother’s side.

Working out the risk of breast cancer from a family history is very complicated. The more cases of breast cancer there are in the family and the younger the women were at the time of diagnosis, the higher the risk to other family members. If there are women in the family who develop breast cancer at a very young age (less than 40) the risk is further increased.

> A family history of breast cancer on the side of either the mother or father is an important risk factor.

Note
:	A number of mutations in genes such as BRCA 1 and 2 have been identified as carrying a high risk for breast cancer.

### 2-6 Are other cancers associated with breast cancer?

There are several other cancers that may also be a risk factor for breast cancer. The important ones are ovarian cancer and prostate cancer.

### 2-7 What questions should be asked in the past medical history?

*	The most important question to ask is whether the woman has had breast cancer before. If she has and has a new complaint, it may well be a cancer-related problem.
*	It is important to ask whether she has had other cancers, particularly ovarian cancer.
*	Ask about previous operations to the breasts. Women often do not tell you if they have had plastic surgery unless you ask!

### 2-8 What present history should be taken?

*	Always take a general medical history.
*	Ask general questions.
*	Take a history of the presenting breast complaint.
*	Ask specific questions about the breasts.

### 2-9 Why take a general medical history?

Although a woman may present with a breast complaint she may have other important medical problems. These may or may not be related to the breast complaint but still need to be managed.

### 2-10 What general questions are important?

Ask about:

*	Her menstrual cycle. It is important to know whether she is pre- or post-menopausal or pregnant.
*	Is she actively breastfeeding. If not, when did she stop.
*	Has she lost or gained weight recently.
*	Is she taking any medications: some drugs can cause women to produce milk.

### 2-11 What history should be taken about the breast complaint?

It is important to ask what the main complaint is and whether one or both breasts are affected. If one, which breast is affected?

Unfortunately there are no presenting complaints that reliably indicate that the patient has breast cancer. In addition there are many non-cancerous breast problems that can give the same symptoms as breast cancer.

While the history can strongly suggest that the patient has breast cancer, the diagnosis cannot be made on the history alone.

> There are no presenting complaints that always indicate breast cancer.

### 2-12 What are the commonest breast complaints?

The commonest breast complaints are:

*	Lump in the breast
*	Pain in the breast
*	Discharge from the nipple
*	Change in breast appearance
*	Breast increasing in size
*	Lump in the armpit
*	Redness of the breast
*	Thickening of the breast
*	Nipple change

The important questions to be asked depend on the main complaint. This additional information is very helpful in identifying the cause of the complaint.

### 2-13 What questions should be asked about a lump in the breast?

*	How long has the lump been present?
*	Have you had a lump like this before?
*	Is the lump painful? If it is painful she should be asked whether the lump or the pain presented first. If she noticed the lump first then it should be considered a painless lump. Lumps nearly always become tender once they have been noticed.
*	Has the lump changed in size since it was noticed? If the patient is still menstruating and the lump has been there for over a month, ask whether it altered during menstruation.

### 2-14 What questions should be asked about pain in the breast?

*	When did the pain start?
*	Is the pain related to menstruation?
*	Is the pain worse in any particular part of your breast?
*	Can you put a finger on the point of tenderness?

### 2-15 What questions should be asked about discharge from the nipple?

*	Are you pregnant?
*	What colour is the discharge?
*	Is it from a single place on the nipple or from more than one place?
*	Does it stain your clothes? This gives a good idea of the amount of discharge.
*	Is there a discharge from both nipples?
*	Does it come out without the breast being squeezed?

### 2-16 What questions should be asked about the change in appearance of the breast?

*	When did you first notice the change in appearance?
*	In what way has the breast changed? Colour, skin appearance, shape, symmetry or size.

### 2-17 What questions should be asked about a breast increasing in size?

*	Have both breasts become bigger or only one breast?
*	Have you put on weight in general?
*	Are you pregnant?
*	Are you on any drugs such as ARVs? (Antiretroviral drugs for HIV may cause the breasts to increase in size.)

### 2-18 What questions should be asked about a lump in the armpit?

*	Have you got lumps anywhere else? Particularly in the groins, armpits or neck.
*	Have you had a fever?
*	Do you have a cough?
*	Have you had an injury to your arm in the last month? Specifically ask about burns to the hand from cooking.
*	Always ask about HIV status.

### 2-19 What questions should be asked about redness of the breast?

*	Is it associated with any pain or tenderness?
*	Is it associated with a fever?
*	Are you pregnant?
*	Are you a smoker?
*	Has it changed since it was first noticed?
*	How long has it been present?

### 2-20 What questions should be asked about thickening of the breast?

With thickening an area of the breast tissue feels more dense (firmer) than the surrounding tissue:

*	Is there thickening in both breasts?
*	How long has it been present?
*	Has it changed since it was first noticed?

### 2-21 What questions should be asked about nipple changes?

*	Has the nipple inverted (gone in): if so, when?
*	Has the skin over the nipple changed?
*	Have the changes happened to both breasts?

Having taken a careful history and asked the important questions, the patient’s breasts should now be thoroughly examined.

## The examination of the breasts

### 2-22 How should the patient be prepared for a breast examination?

If the patient is comfortable, she should undress down to her waist and put on a gown. The examination must be done somewhere private and well lit. Always explain what you are going to do.

Most women will be comfortable sitting undressed down to the waist. However, some teenagers may be uncomfortable and women who have large tumours may be very reluctant to show you their breasts particularly if the tumour is fungating (ulcerated and often smells offensive).

It is very important to be able to have a good look at both breasts.

### 2-23 How should a step-by-step examination of the breast be done?

The examination consists of both looking (inspection) and feeling (palpating). Wherever possible, the examination should be done in a standardised step-by-step manner. Once you have done a breast examination a few times, it will become quite quick.

1.	Sit the patient down on the examining couch and *look* at her breasts with her arms relaxed. Look for breast asymmetry, nipple inversion, skin changes and redness.
2.	Ask the patient to raise her arms above the head. Look for any skin puckering. Ask the patient to point out where the problem is. Look specifically in that area to see if there is any change in the skin while she is moving her arm. This will help identify if a lump is attached to the skin.
3.	Ask the patient to put her hands on her hips and squeeze. Look and see if the area over the lump changes. This will show whether a lump is attached (tethered) to underlying muscle.

	> The breasts should be examined from the front with the patient sitting and relaxed, then with the arms raised and finally with the hands pressing on the hips.

4.	Feel in the area above the clavicle (collar bone) for any lumps in the neck.
5.	To examine the armpits properly the patient must be relaxed. If the patient is very ticklish it helps to press more firmly. The best way to get the patient to relax her muscles is by asking her to extend her arms and rest them on your shoulders while you examine the armpits. Feel in the two armpits (axillae) at the same time for any lumps. This allows you to compare the two armpits. The armpits are shaped like pyramids. You should feel along the inside wall and towards the front (anterior) for lymph nodes. Remember to feel at the top of the armpit also. If you think you feel a lump, examine that armpit very carefully. If you think you can feel a lump in one armpit it is best to examine that side alone. Palpating the armpits is an essential part of breast examination.

	> To examine the armpits properly the patient must be relaxed.

6.	Finally lie the patient down flat on her back and palpate (feel) her breasts with her arms above her head. This will flatten the breasts and make examination easier. It is easier to think of the breasts being divided into strips and then palpate each breast from the centre of the chest outwards. The breast extends from the clavicle (collarbone) above to the 6th rib below. The whole area of the breast must be examined. Always use the pulps of your fingers (the most sensitive part of your hand) with the rest of your hand gently resting against the breast. Do not use cold hands.
7.	Never forget to examine behind the nipple-areola complex (NAC) for any abnormalities such as skin changes, lumps or an inverted nipple. It is best to leave the nipple examination to the end once you have won the woman’s trust.

### 2-24 What do you look for when examining the breast?

1.	*Asymmetry*: a woman has 2 breasts which can be compared!
2.	*Skin changes*: the skin changes that are important include:
	*	*Peau d’orange* means skin of an orange and usually indicates that there is a cancer.
	*	Redness. Mark the area of redness.
	*	Note if there are any areas where the skin seems to be stuck to the underlying breast tissue.
3.	*Change in the nipple*. The 3 important things to look for are:
	*	*Inversion*: a nipple pulled in instead of sticking out. This may be normal for the patient but is important if it has changed and the nipple used to stick out.
	*	*Change in the skin* over the nipple: eczema-like changes need to be tested to ensure they are not Paget’s disease which involves the nipple and areola. Eczema is usually confined to the areola. They MUST be biopsied.
	*	*Discharge*: if there is discharge from one or both nipples, note the colour and how many places in the nipple it comes from. Discharge from only one duct is more likely to be associated with malignancy.
4.	There can be any number of skin-related problems that can be seen over the breast: melanomas, other skin cancers or sebaceous cysts.

### 2-25 What should you feel for when examining a breast?

1.	*Lumps in the breast*. It is important to note:
	*	The texture of the lump. The texture may be soft, firm or hard. Soft feels like your lips, firm feels like the tip of your nose, hard is like bone (your forehead).
	*	Whether the lump is fixed to the skin or underlying muscle.
	*	The size of the lump.
	*	If the lump is easy to move or not (mobility).
	*	If the lump has well-defined edges.
2.	*Thickening of the breast*. Women with dense breasts may have normal dense tissue overlying and hiding a small cancer. If there is obvious asymmetry in the thickening, there may be a pathological cause. These patients should be referred for imaging. However, some asymmetry is normal.
3.	*Lumps in the armpit*. It can be normal to feel lymph nodes in a thin patient. Normal lymph nodes are rubbery and mobile. Pathological lymph nodes are firm or hard and are not mobile. If a lymph node is felt, check the arm for burns, cuts or sores. Check the other armpit: if abnormal nodes are felt in both armpits, the patient may have another cause for enlarged nodes, e.g. HIV.

### 2-26 When is the best time to examine a woman’s breasts?

Examining the breasts can be very difficult particularly in young women. They can vary enormously depending on individual changes, the age of the patient and the stage of the menstrual cycle. The ideal time to examine a young woman is between day 6 and14 of her menstrual cycle. (Day 1 being the first day of the period.)

### 2-27 How should a breast examination be performed in a man?

The majority of patients with breast complaints are female. However, there are a number of male patients and they must be treated with empathy and compassion, as they are often very embarrassed to admit to having a problem with their breast. The approach to taking a history and examining the breasts of a man must be the same at that of a woman. It is very important not to ask questions that obviously only relate to women such as the date of the last menstrual period.

A sample form for recording your notes and examination is included as an appendix.

### 2-28 Should women be taught to examine their own breasts?

Yes. All women should be shown how to examine their breasts every month. Women soon get to know what their own breasts look and feel like and can detect any changes.

> All women should be taught to examine their own breasts. They should look for change.

## Case study 1

A 55 year old woman presents with a painless lump in her breast. She feels the lump is new. On examination, she has a hard mass in the upper outer quadrant of the breast.

### 1. With regard to the risk of breast cancer, what are the 3 most important facts given in the history?

The patient is female, 55 years of age and has no family history of breast cancer.

### 2. Does breast cancer only occur in females?

Breast cancer almost always occurs in females. However, breast cancer can occur in males and this should not be missed.

### 3. Why is her age important?

Because the risk of a breast lump being malignant increases with age. The risk at 55 years is between 1 in 23 and 1 in 50.

### 4. What are the next most important questions to ask?

*	When did she have her last period if she is premenopausal?
*	Is the lump painful?
*	How long has the lump been there?
*	Has it changed since it was first noticed?

### 5. What specific factors are important to look for in the examination? 

*	Any area of overlying skin that appears to be attached to underlying tissue
*	Inversion of the nipple
*	Skin changes such as *peau d’orange*

### 6. What should you feel for on palpation?

*	Size of the lump
*	The firmness of the lump: sort, firm or hard
*	The mobility of the lump: is the lump fixed to skin or muscle or does it seem to move freely?
*	Are the lymph nodes palpable in the armpit on that side?

## Case study 2

A young woman of 23 years visits her general practitioner with an upper respiratory infection. While taking a history she mentions that her father’s mother had breast cancer.

### 1. Why is a family history of breast cancer important?

Because breast cancer is more common in some families.

### 2. Is a history of breast cancer on the father’s side of the family important?

Yes. A family history of breast cancer is important on both the mother’s and father’s side of the family.

### 3. Is it likely that she has breast cancer?

No, as breast cancer is very uncommon in a woman of 22 years old.

### 4. Why is the age at which the family member presented with breast cancer important?

Because the younger the woman was when breast cancer was diagnosed the higher is the risk to other family members. If there are women in the family who develop breast cancer at less than 40 years, the risk is further increased.

### 5. What other cancer in the family will increase the risk of breast cancer?

Ovarian and prostate cancer.

## Case study 3

A young woman presents with a nipple discharge from one breast. She is very embarrassed and asks if she can keep her T-shirt on during the examination. The general practitioner, who is in a hurry, agrees and examines her breasts with her lying down. Her armpits are not examined. He only then asks about the discharge but not about her past or family history.

### 1. What is the problem with the way the history was taken?

Always start with the history before beginning the examination. Always take a present, past and family history. He should have asked whether she was pregnant as this could be the cause of the nipple discharge. Never rush a breast examination.

### 2. Can you examine a woman’s breast without her undressing?

No, as breast inspection is important. He needed to assess whether the discharge was from one or multiple sites on her nipple. She need only undress to the waist.

### 3. In what position should the woman be in when her breasts are examined?

First sitting up with her arms at her sides and then held above her head. Following this she should be examined with her hands pressing against her hips and finally examined lying down with her arms extended above her head.

### 4. How should the armpits (axillae) be examined?

Get the woman to relax her muscles by asking her to extend her arms and rest them on your shoulders while you examine her armpits.

Feel in the two armpits (axillae) at the same time as this allows you to compare the two sides. You should feel along the inside wall and towards the front (anterior) for lymph nodes. Remember to feel at the top of the armpit also. If you think you can feel a lump in one armpit it is best to examine that side alone.

### 5. What other lymph nodes should be palpated for?

The supraclavicular nodes.

### 6. Why should her armpits be examined?

Because it is part of the full breast examinations. It is important to feel for enlarged lymph nodes.

# Special investigations of the breast

## Objectives

When you have completed this chapter you should be able to:

*	Describe the triple test.
*	List the breast imaging options.
*	Describe breast screening.
*	Understand the importance of mammograms and ultrasound scans.
*	Explain the advantages and limitations of cytology and histology.
*	Describe how a sample of breast tissue can be obtained.

## Case study 1

A 45 year old women presents with a lump in her left breast. She has not been screened for breast cancer before. Her sister had breast cancer at the age of 41.

1.	Should she have been screened before?
2.	What is population screening for breast cancer?
3.	What investigations should she have?
4.	What is cytology?

## Case study 2

A 69 year old woman presents with a large ulcerating tumour of the breast. She has lumps in the opposite breast and has palpable nodes in both axillae.

1.	What is the most likely diagnosis?
2.	What investigation should be done?
3.	What is a core biopsy?
4.	What are the advantages of a core biopsy over an excision biopsy?

## Case study 3

A 30 year old woman presents with a small lump in her right breast. A mammogram shows an area of microcalcification.

1.	Should all women who find a lump in their breast be investigated?
2.	What imaging is usually done first in a 30 year old?
3.	What is the significance of microcalcification?
4.	What forms of cancer are difficult to detect on a mammogram?

## Case study 4

A postmenopausal woman of 58 presents with a lump in her breast. She has not been screened for breast cancer and has no family history of cancer. The general practitioner can feel the lump and refers her for scanning and cytology.

1.	Would a mammogram be reliable in this woman?
2.	If the mammogram shows no mass is further investigation indicated?
3.	What are the advantages of a fine needle aspiration rather than a core biopsy or an excision biopsy?
4.	Can a fine needle biopsy give a false negative result?

## Special investigations

### 3-1 Why are special investigations of the breast sometimes needed?

If the history and clinical examination suggests that there might be a cancer in a breast, it is best if the problem can be diagnosed without having to operate. This requires special investigations.

> The aim of special investigations is to make a diagnosis without having to do surgery.

### 3-2 What is the triple test?

The triple test is a combination of 3 different ways of investigating the breast:

*	Clinical assessment (history and examination)
*	Imaging
*	Cytology

All three investigations should agree for the diagnosis to be accepted. An accurate diagnosis can usually be obtained with the triple test but the diagnosis should be confirmed with a histological diagnosis.

> The triple test of clinical examination, imaging and cytology can usually give an accurate diagnosis if all three agree but the diagnosis should be confirmed with histology.

## Breast imaging

### 3-3 What breast imaging options are available?

*	Mammogram
*	Ultrasound scan
*	MRI scan

### 3-4 What is a mammogram?

A mammogram is a radiological investigation (mammography) in which the breast is compressed and then X-rayed. The underlying breast tissue is seen and abnormalities may be detected. A mass is an abnormal area, which may have the appearance of being cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). 

### 3-5 What is an ultrasound scan?

An ultrasound scan (ultrasonography) is a way of imaging tissue using sound waves. Different types of breast tissue absorb and reflect the sound waves in different ways and produce a computerised picture. Cancers usually look different from non-cancerous masses. An ultrasound scan is good at telling the difference between a solid and a cystic mass.

### 3-6 What is an MRI scan?

An MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging scan) is a special scan using large magnets that produces pictures of the breast. It is not widely used and should only be requested by specialist breast units.

### 3-7 When should any imaging of the breast be done?

*	*Screening*: population and individual screening
*	Investigation of a clinical complaint

## Breast screening

### 3-8 What is breast screening?

Screening (surveillance) is looking for a disease before it is clinically obvious to either the patient or an examining doctor. It is looking for a hidden disease in people who appear to be well. Many diseases are screened for, such as cervical and breast cancer.

Breast cancer is screened for using clinical examination and a mammogram.

> Breast screening uses clinical examination and a mammogram to look for cancer in people who are clinically healthy.

### 3-9 What is population screening for breast cancer?

Population screening means screening all women over a certain age in the general population. The aim is to detect early breast cancers in women who have no breast complaints. Ideally a breast examination and mammogram should be done.

Most developing countries, such as South Africa, do not have a population breast cancer-screening programme in the public sector. Most developed countries have population screening for breast cancer. Population screening for breast cancer is a low priority in the public sector in South Africa and is controversial in developed countries.

> Population mammogram screening for breast cancer includes all women over a certain age.

### 3-10 When should population screening for breast cancer be done?

The frequency of mammogram screening and the age at which it starts depends on the country. Mammogram screening programmes start at 40 years of age in the USA and are done every year. In Europe, it often starts at 50 years of age and mammograms are done every 1 to 3 years.

### 3-11 What is individual screening?

In countries without a public breast screening programme, such as South Africa, some individuals who can afford it may go for regular monitoring. This is known as individual screening or surveillance. The frequency and age when individual screening should start is the same as that for population screening.

If a woman has a family history of breast cancer, she should be offered screening starting at the age of 40 or 10 years before the age of the youngest family member when she presented with breast cancer, whichever comes first. She should be screened every year.

> Screening may start earlier in women who are at an increased risk of breast cancer.

### 3-12 When should women with a breast complaint go for imaging?

*	All women over the age of 40 years with any breast complaint should have a mammogram. They may be referred for an ultrasound scan as well.
*	For patients under 40 years, it depends on the complaint. Any woman over the age of 25 with a breast lump should be referred for breast imaging. This should initially be an ultrasound in younger women although the breast unit may decide to do a mammogram as well.

Both a mammogram and ultrasound scan may be used for individual screening. An ultrasound scan is often done first in younger women as they have firm breasts.

> Any woman with a breast complaint over the age of 40 should have a mammogram.

Mammograms

### 3-13 What abnormalities may be found on a mammogram?

A mammogram may be normal or may show:

*	*Microcalcifications*: these are specks of calcium, which are due to abnormal cells. These abnormal cells may be benign or malignant.
*	*A mass*: this implies there is a breast lump, which may look benign or malignant on a mammogram.
*	*‘Architectural distortion’* which means that the breast tissue does not have the normal appearance. The change is generally an area of straight lines and may be associated with a lump or area of calcifications. It is most commonly due to either a cancer or previous surgery.

> 15% of breast cancers do not show up on a mammogram.

### 3-14 Is a mammogram painful?

A mammogram should not be very painful, but there is discomfort when the breast is squeezed, especially in young women with firm breasts. An ultrasound scan is not painful.

### 3-15 Can a mammogram cause cancer?

There is no significant risk of getting cancer from a mammogram.

### 3-16 What happens if the mammogram is abnormal?

The abnormal area must be further investigated (tested).

> Any abnormality on a mammogram must be investigated.

### 3-17 How is the abnormal area seen on a mammogram investigated further?

*	If a lump can be felt, the area is investigated with a fine needle aspiration or a core biopsy (see later).
*	If the area cannot be felt (is not palpable), it has to be tested under mammographic or ultrasound guidance. 
*	Hookwire-guided excision biopsy; a special needle is placed in the area of abnormal tissue and hooked into position. In theatre this area is then easy to find and is removed surgically.

### 3-18 What are microcalcifications?

Microcalcifications are specks of calcium seen on a mammogram. They can be caused by a number of conditions, including:

*	Malignant cells. These may be from an invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
*	Microcysts
*	Scar tissue

There are different patterns of micro­calcification seen and these will generally give an idea of whether the calcifications are malignant or benign. Any new microcalcifications in a post­menopausal woman must be biopsied as there is a high risk of malignancy.

### 3-19 How reliable is a mammogram in detecting cancer?

Mammograms are helpful but 15% of cancers do not show up on a mammogram, especially in younger women. The accuracy of the mammogram depends on:

*	*The age of the woman*: A mammogram is more reliable in women over the age of 50, as they usually have less dense (fatty) breasts, which appear dark on a mammogram. The breasts of postmenopausal women are softer with more fat and therefore easier to compress to obtain good views on a mammogram. This makes it easier to see a cancer. Mammograms are therefore better for the population screening of older women.
*	*The breast density*: Women under the age of 40 often have dense (firm) breasts. However, some older women have particularly dense breasts. In women with firm or dense breasts, the breast tissue appears white on the mammogram, which may make a cancer difficult to find.
*	*Menopausal status*: Mammograms are more reliable after menopause when breasts tend to be fatty.
*	*The type of breast cancer*: Lobular cancers may be difficult to see as they do not show up as well on mammograms. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may show up on a mammogram.

The reliability of a mammogram depends on how dense the breast is and what type of cancer the woman has.

## Ultrasound scan

### 3-20 Who should have an ultrasound scan?

*	Younger women as they have firm breasts. As mammograms are less reliable in these women they should rather have an ultrasound scan.
*	Some women over 50 with dense breasts may also be advised to have an ultrasound scan.

Ultrasound scans are being used more often as they are getting better at detecting very small cancers. Many women who have a mammogram will also have an ultrasound.

> An ultrasound scan is particularly useful in younger women.

### 3-21 Can an ultrasound scan show the difference between a cancerous and non-cancerous lump?

Yes. A cancerous lump usually has a typical appearance on an ultrasound scan while a benign lump looks quite different.

> It is always better to make a diagnosis without having to do an operation. However, a diagnosis must always be made.

An ultrasound scan is good at showing the difference between a cyst and a solid lump. However, ultrasound cannot be used to look for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

> An ultrasound scan is good at showing the difference between a cyst and a solid lump.

### 3-22 How can a lump seen on an ultrasound be investigated?

Under ultrasound guidance, a thin needle can be put into the lump and cells can be removed for cytology (fine needle aspiration). Under ultrasound guidance, a core biopsy can also be taken for histology.

A disadvantage of ultrasound scanning is that, unlike a mammogram, it does not detect carcinoma in situ.

> Unlike a mammogram an ultrasound scan does not detect carcinoma in situ.

## MRI scanning

### 3-23 When is an MRI scan useful?

This is a specialist test and should only be requested by a specialist unit.

## Cytology

### 3-24 What is cytology?

Cytology is the examination of cells obtained from an aspirate (something which is sucked out). The cells are studied under a microscope to see if they look cancerous or not. Cytology is one of three parts of the triple test.

### 3-25 How can one get a sample for cytology?

A fine needle aspiration (FNA) can be performed. This involves using a thin 22G needle and a 10 ml syringe. The needle is passed into the mass (lump or cyst) and cells or fluid are aspirated. Usually the lump is sampled a number of times in slightly different places (multiple passes). The aspirate is placed on a number of glass slides, which are then sprayed with a fixative solution (as with a Pap smear). The slides are sent for examination.

### 3-26 What results can cytology give?

*	*Inadequate*: that means that too few cells have been removed to confidently make a diagnosis.
*	*Benign*: normal looking breast cells or a diagnosis of fibrocystic change, fibroadenoma or fat necrosis.
*	*Atypical*: some cells look abnormal. A core biopsy must always be done if the FNA result is atypical.
*	*Suspicious*: the lump is probably a cancer but the diagnosis cannot be made for certain.
*	*Malignant*: the lump is definitely malignant.

### 3-27 What do breast cells look like? 

Normal breast cells have a well-formed nucleus and cytoplasm. All the cells look the same. The malignant cells look abnormal with large nuclei and abnormal cytoplasm. The cells look very different from one another. 

### 3-28 What are the advantages of cytology?

*	It is a simple procedure that can be performed in a clinic by a doctor or nurse who has been trained in the technique.
*	The results may be obtained the same day.
*	It is relatively painless and local anaesthetic is not needed.
*	If the mass is a cyst, it may be aspirated completely and disappear. It is very unlikely that a cyst will be malignant. If the fluid from a cyst is bloody, the aspirated sample must be sent for cytology.

### 3-29 What are the problems with cytology?

Problems with cytology are:

*	Cytology can give false positive or negative results.
*	The incorrect preparation of the slides can give false results.
*	The interpretation of the slides can be difficult.
*	The cells may be hidden behind a film of blood.
*	A pneumothorax may be caused if the needle is put in too deeply and penetrates the underlying lung. This is more common if the woman is thin and the lump deep or at the edge of the breast. If a pneumothorax develops the patient will suddenly complain of chest pain during the procedure and may become short of breath.

Although cytology seems a simple procedure, the results can be inaccurate due to inaccurate sampling or interpretation.

> Cytology gives very variable results.

### 3-30 How can cytology give a false positive result?

‘False positive’ means the cytology appearance suggests a lump is malignant when it is in fact benign:

*	If the cytology is malignant, it is usually very cellular. That means there are lots of cells on the slides. Some benign lesions, such as fibroadenoma, can give a similar result.
*	Pregnant women will have very cellular aspirates, as their breasts are very active (cells growing fast).

### 3-31 How can cytology give a false negative result?

‘False negative’ means the cytology suggests the lump is benign but it is in fact malignant.

*	The needle may miss the lump. This is particularly common if the fine needle aspirate is done under ultrasound guidance because the lump is so small.
*	The whole lump is not always cancerous and the needle may be inserted into the supportive tissue and not into the malignant area of the lump.
*	On cytology a slow-growing cancer may look like normal breast tissue.
*	Lobular cancers are very difficult to diagnose with cytology as the cells may appear normal.
*	Ductal carcinoma in situ can also be difficult to diagnose with cytology as cells may not be obtained from within the duct.

As a result of false positive and negative results, fine needle aspiration has been replaced by core biopsy in some larger hospitals.

## Histology

### 3-32 What is histology?

Histology means a sample of solid tissue is examined under a microscope. This is a very helpful way of making a diagnosis.

### 3-33 How can a piece of tissue be obtained?

It is obtained by biopsy. A core of tissue can be taken with a core biopsy (Tru-cut) needle under local anaesthetic. A core biopsy needle is a special device that cuts a core of tissue. This can be done by hand (if the lump is palpable) or under ultrasound guidance if the lump is difficult to feel. When it is done in combination with a mammogram it is called a stereotactic biopsy. This requires special equipment.

The large needle is introduced through a small cut made in the skin with a scalpel. A number of ‘bites’ of the lump are taken. The pieces of tissue are placed in formalin and sent for examination.

A radiologist or a breast specialist usually does the core biopsy.

### 3-34 How accurate is histology?

It is very accurate if the correct area is sampled.

### 3-35 What are the disadvantages of a core biopsy?

*	It may give a false negative result.
*	It is unpleasant for the patient.
*	A haematoma (bruise) may be caused by the procedure.
*	It is more expensive than cytology but cheaper than an excision biopsy.

### 3-36 How can a core biopsy give a false negative result?

The lump to be biopsied may be missed or the pieces of tissue obtained may be too small for an accurate assessment. Therefore the result of a core biopsy must be interpreted together with the results from the clinical examination and imaging.

> The results of a core biopsy must always be considered together with the result of the mammogram or ultrasound scan.

## Excision biopsy

### 3-37 What is an excision biopsy?

It is a procedure of removing a piece of tissue or the whole lump by surgery in an operating theatre. If the lump can be felt, it can be taken out without any imaging before the operation. If the lump is only seen on mammogram or ultrasound scan, the patient should have a needle placed into the lump during imaging before the operation. This makes the lump easier to find at surgery. Excision biopsy can be done under local or general anaesthetic.

Although it is ideal to make a diagnosis without having to perform an excision biopsy, it is sometimes necessary to remove a piece of tissue as many facilities do not have the equipment or experience for a core biopsy.

It is still true to say: ‘If in doubt, take it out’ but with more sophisticated investigations, the diagnosis can often be made without surgery.

### 3-38 What are the advantages of an excision biopsy?

*	It will provide a definite diagnosis.
*	It can be done with simple facilities.
*	The surrounding tissue can also be sampled.

### 3-39 What is the disadvantage of an excision biopsy?

*	It involves an operation.
*	It is more expensive.
*	It will leave a scar on the breast, which may show up as an abnormal area on a subsequent mammogram.
*	There may be a haematoma post­operatively.
*	Cosmetically it may leave a hollow and lead to an abnormal appearance of the breast.

## Case study 1

A 45 year old women presents with a lump in her left breast. She has not been screened for breast cancer before. Her sister had breast cancer at the age of 41.

### 1. Should she have been screened before?

Yes, as her sister had breast cancer. With a family history of breast cancer, a woman should be offered screening starting at the age of 40 or 10 years before the age of the youngest family member with breast cancer, whichever comes first. Therefore she should have been screened regularly from the age of 31 years as she is at increased risk of breast cancer.

### 2. What is population screening for breast cancer?

Screening of all women in the population usually starting between 40 and 50 years of age. There is no public population screening for breast cancer in South Africa but many healthy women in the private sector are regularly screened even though they have no symptoms or signs of breast cancer.

### 3. What investigations should she have?

She should have a mammogram and possibly an ultrasound scan also. Then she should have a core biopsy of the lump. If the imaging suggests it is a cyst, she should have a needle aspiration. 

### 4. What is cytology?

Cytology is the examination under a microscope of cells obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a lump or cyst.

## Case study 2

A 69 year old woman presents with a large ulcerating tumour of the breast. She has lumps in the opposite breast and has palpable nodes in both axillae.

### 1. What is the most likely diagnosis?

The most likely diagnosis is breast cancer.

### 2. What investigation should be done?

She should have a core biopsy of the tumour.

### 3. What is a core biopsy?

The removal of a core of tissue using a core biopsy (Tru-cut) needle. The tissue is sent for histological examination.

### 4. What are the advantages of a core biopsy over an excision biopsy?

It is cheaper than an excision biopsy and does not need an operation. With a large tumour like this a core biopsy will obtain the tissue needed to confirm the clinical diagnosis of cancer. Large tumours are difficult to remove so an excision biopsy with removal of the whole lump is generally not possible.

## Case study 3

A 30 year old woman presents with a small lump in her right breast. A mammogram shows an area of microcalcification.

### 1. Should all women who find a lump in their breast be investigated?

Yes. She should have a triple test of clinical assessment (history and examination), imaging and cytology. The results should be confirmed with a core biopsy.

### 2. What imaging is usually done first in a 30 year old?

Usually an ultrasound scan is done first in a young woman with firm (dense) breasts, as a lump can be difficult to see. If the ultrasound is worrying, a mammogram is done.

### 3. What is the significance of microcalcification?

It may indicate the presence of a cancer.

### 4. What forms of cancer are difficult to detect on a mammogram?

A lobular cancer as it does not show up well on a mammogram.

## Case study 4

A postmenopausal woman of 58 presents with a lump in her breast. She has not been screened for breast cancer and has no family history of cancer. The general practitioner can feel the lump and refers her for scanning and cytology.

### 1. Would a mammogram be reliable in this woman?

Usually. Mammograms are more reliable in postmenopausal women who tend to have fatty breasts.

### 2. If the mammogram shows no mass is further investigation indicated?

Yes. An ultrasound should be done. A fine needle aspiration would obtain cells for cytology. NB: A triple test is only valid if all the results add up. A core biopsy must be taken on any palpable mass in a 58 year old woman.

### 3. What are the advantages of a fine needle aspiration rather than a core biopsy or an excision biopsy?

It is simple, cheap, does not require anaesthesia and the results can be obtained the same day.

### 4. Can a fine needle biopsy give a false negative result?

Yes. The needle may miss the lump or only a non-cancerous part of the lump may be aspirated.

*	Diagnose and manage breast cysts.
*	Manage a woman with painful breasts (mastalgia).
*	Manage common nipple problems.
*	Diagnose the cause of and manage nipple discharge.

1.	What is a fibroadenoma?
2.	Is it malignant?
3.	What does a fibroadenoma feel like on palpation?
4.	At what age are fibroadenomas common?
5.	How should this woman be managed?

## Case study 2

A 49 year old woman visits a district hospital as she has found a breast lump. She is very anxious as her mother died of breast cancer. A mammogram and ultrasound scan show a typical simple cyst. The medical officer aspirates green fluid from the cyst.

1.	What is a cyst?

## Introduction to benign changes to the breast

### 4-1 What normal changes are found in a woman’s breast as she gets older?

Many normal changes occur in a woman’s breast as she becomes older. Most of these are included in the concept of ANDI (aberrations of normal development and involution).

### 4-2 What conditions are included in ANDI?

ANDI includes all the benign changes that take place in the breasts with age. For example lumps may develop within the breast tissue. It is very important to remember that there is always a cause for a breast lump and that the diagnosis must fit the age of the patient. In this chapter, the various benign conditions will be looked at in more detail.

### 4-3 What is a breast lump?

A lump is a local area of firm tissue that can be felt in a breast. The lump is firmer than the surrounding breast. Usually a woman is concerned about a lump because she has not noticed it before.

### 4-4 Why are breast lumps important?

Because they may be malignant (a cancer). Fortunately most breast lumps are benign.

### 4-5 What does benign mean?

Benign means that the condition (e.g. a breast lump) is not malignant, i.e. not cancerous. A benign lump may increase in size but does not spread into the surrounding tissue to elsewhere in the body.

> A benign lump may get bigger but does not spread.

### 4-6 What questions should be asked while taking a history from a woman with a breast lump?

*	How long has the lump been present?
*	Have you had a lump like this before?
*	Is the lump painful? If it is painful she should be asked whether the lump or the pain presented first. If she noticed the lump first then it should be considered a painless lump. Lumps nearly always become tender once they have been noticed.
*	Has the lump changed in size since it was noticed? If the patient is still menstruating and the lump has been there for over a month, ask whether it altered during menstruation.

### 4-7 What are common causes of a benign lump in the breast?

The two commonest causes of benign conditions associated with a breast lump are:

*	A fibroadenoma
*	A cyst

However, it is always possible that the lump may be malignant.

> Most breast lumps are fibroadenomas or cysts.

## Breast fibroadenomas

### 4-8 What is a fibroadenoma?

The woman may have one fibro­adenoma or many fibroadenomas (fibroadenomata). A fibroadenoma consists of both fibrous and glandular tissue.

### 4-9 Who usually gets fibroadenomas?

The majority of women who develop a fibroadenoma are under the age of 35. Therefore most new breast lumps in young women are fibroadenomas. After the age of 40, breast cancer becomes a commoner cause of a lump in the breast.

> Fibroadenomas are usually seen in young women.

### 4-10 What do fibroadenomas feel like?

They are round and movable. They feel rubbery and tend to move under the fingers when the breast is examined.

### 4-11 What happens over time to fibroadenomas if they are not removed?

They tend to grow to a size of 1 to 3 cm and most stay at that size. However some will increase in size and may get to be 6 cm or larger. Over decades, they will tend to get smaller. It is common to have more than one fibroadenoma.

### 4-12 What investigations should a woman have if fibroadenomas are suspected?

*	Fibroadenomas in young patients (less than 20 years) do not need any specific investigations.
*	Ultrasound scan: shows a round, dark mass with sharp edges. The normal breast tissue tends to ‘flow’ over the lump.
*	Mammography if the woman is older than 40: fibroadenomas look round on a mammogram and are generally white.
*	Cytology: A fine needle aspiration and cytology is very helpful as the cytology is usually typical. However, fibroadenomas can be difficult to diagnose as sometimes they do not show the typical changes, especially in pregnancy.

A fibroadenoma cannot be definitely diagnosed using ultrasound scanning and cytology alone. If a core (Tru-cut) biopsy is not going to be performed then all 3 tests (clinical, ultrasound and cytology) must suggest that the lump is a fibroadenoma.

The best test to confirm the diagnosis of a fibroadenoma is a core biopsy.

### 4-13 What is a core (Tru-cut) biopsy?

This is a small sample of tissue taken with a special core (Tru-cut) biopsy needle. The tissue is then examined under a microscope (histology). The advantage of this method is that it causes minimal trauma and does not require the whole lump to be removed. However, if there is any doubt about the result of the core biopsy it is best to remove the lump.

A core biopsy will give a tissue diagnosis and will also sample some of the surrounding tissue. A core biopsy showing typical changes would give a definite diagnosis.

> If in doubt take the lump out.

### 4-14 What happens to a fibroadenoma during pregnancy?

It gets bigger during the pregnancy but will go back to the original size at the end of pregnancy or may even decrease in size.

### 4-15 Are fibroadenomas associated with an increased risk of breast cancer?

There is a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer. Anyone who is older than 35 and develops a new fibroadenoma should have mammograms once a year after the age of 40.

What is most important is that a cancer may feel like a fibroadenoma.

> A breast cancer may feel like a fibroadenoma.

### 4-16 How should fibroadenomas be treated?

If a confident diagnosis of fibroadenomas has been made they can be left with no treatment. However, they should be taken out if they are very big (greater than 5 cm) or painful. They should also be taken out if the women is intending to fall pregnant as it can be very worrying for her if she has a breast lump increasing in size during her pregnancy.

## Breast cysts

### 4-17 What are cysts?

Cysts are benign (non-cancerous) lumps in the breast that are filled with fluid. The fluid may be yellow, green or very dark.

There may be microcysts (very small cycts) or macrocysts (larger cysts). Macrocysts are larger than 1 cm and may be felt as a lump. Usually small cysts can only be seen on a mammogram and ultrasound scan.

The cysts may not be distended with fluid in which case they are soft. A cyst is like a balloon. The more it is filled up, the more it is palpable. If it is only partially filled, it may not be palpable as it is soft. Therefore it is possible to have large cysts that cannot be felt.

### 4-18 What causes cysts?

Cysts are associated with shrinkage of the lobes of the breast (involution). This occurs with age so cysts commonly occur in women in their 40s. One in ten women will get cysts that can be felt at some point in their lives. Even more will have cysts on a mammogram or ultrasound scan.

> Breast cysts are common in women in their 40s.

### 4-19 What problems may cysts cause?

Cysts cause anxiety because the woman may fear she has cancer. The cyst may also be tender. 

### 4-20 What happens to cysts?

If they are untreated, they tend to disappear after menopause. Women who are on HRT (hormone replacement therapy) may continue to get cysts.

### 4-21 How should cysts be investigated?

As they generally occur in women over 40 years of age, they should have a mammogram to make sure they are simple cysts. It must not be assumed on clinical examination alone that a breast cyst is benign.

### 4-22 How should cysts be treated?

The most important thing is to make a diagnosis and make sure it is not a cancer. Some cysts should be aspirated.

### 4-23 Which cysts should be aspirated?

Not all cysts need to be aspirated. However, a cyst should be aspirated if:

*	It is palpable.
*	It looks unusual on the ultrasound scan or mammogram.
*	It is hard and tender. Draining the cyst provides relief to the patient. 

A 23G needle can be put into a cyst to drain it. This is called fine needle aspiration (FNA). It will provide relief for the woman if it is a painful cyst and will also give an instant diagnosis. If the fluid is not blood stained, it does not need to be sent off for cytology. Blood from a cyst indicates that the cyst may be malignant. All bloody fluid must be sent for histology.

> Blood from a cyst indicates that the cyst may be malignant.

### 4-24 What is fibrocystic change?

Fibrocystic change is a very common cause of lumpy, tender breasts usually seen in women between 30 and 50 years of age. The changes are due to the variation on hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. Many small lumps of glandular tissue, cysts and areas of fibrosis occur.

Cysts may be macrocysts (greater than 1 cm) or smaller in which case they are called microcysts.

> Painful breasts

### 4-25 What is mastalgia?

Mastalgia means tender or painful breasts.

### 4-26 Who gets mastalgia?

Over 70% women will get mastalgia at some time in their lives. It is nearly always associated with normal breasts. It is commonest in adolescence and in women in their 40s.

If women are not taking HRT and are over 40 years of age, they may not have mastalgia but may have musculoskeletal pain (pain in the muscles or joints).

### 4-27 What is the typical history of mastalgia?

The pain is commonly in the upper outer quadrant of the breast as that is where most of the breast tissue is. The classic history is that pain increases before the menstrual period and gets better afterwards. This is so-called cyclical mastalgia.

> The breast pain in cyclical mastalgia gets better after menstruation.

### 4-28 What questions should be asked about pain in the breast?

*	When did the pain start?
*	Is the pain related to menstruation?
*	Is the pain worse in the upper outer part of your breast?
*	Can you put a finger on the point of tenderness?

### 4-29 What is usually found on breast examination in a woman with mastalgia?

Generally the breasts are normal on examination. It is important to always examine the breasts carefully when a woman presents with mastalgia as some women who find a lump are too nervous to say they have a lump so instead say they have pain.

### 4-30 How should women with mastalgia be investigated?

Women over 40 should have a mammogram. Although cancer is very rarely associated with mastalgia, many women will not feel better until they know they have not got cancer.

Breast cancer is not a cause of mastalgia except in obvious and advanced cases.

### 4-31 How can cyclical mastalgia be treated?

Most women with mastalgia are concerned that they have breast cancer. Thoughtful and appropriate reassurance of this concern is the key treatment for mastalgia. Mastalgia is not a disease that requires medical intervention and medication.

Beside reassurance, the best common sense advice is for the woman to get a new bra! Nearly half of all women wear the wrong sized bra. Bras are expensive but they are cheaper than doctors. Most women will be relieved if they know they have not got cancer.

If there is no improvement, lots of remedies have been tried. The only drugs that have been shown to work are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents e.g. Brufen and Voltaren. They should ideally be given as a skin cream to rub onto the painful area so there are no side effects. Antibiotics and diuretics have no role.

Some people report that evening primrose oil improved their pain, but it has not been shown to work in big trials.

> Most women with mastalgia will get better after reassurance that they do not have cancer.

## Non-cancerous changes of the nipple-areola complex

### 4-32 What are important non-cancerous changes in the areola and nipple?

Changes under the nipple and areola (nipple-areola complex) include:

*	Duct ectasia and periductal mastitis
*	Nipple problems
*	Nipple discharge

### 4-33 What is duct ectasia?

Duct ectasia is the dilatation of the ducts under the nipple-areola complex. Its is part of the normal ageing process of the breast. Normally the ducts are about 1 mm in diameter. However, with age, they become wider and blocked. 

Although it is generally seen in older women, it may present at a younger age.

These changes are normal with ageing and usually do not cause problems.

### 4-34 What is periductal mastitis?

Periductal mastitis (PDM) is an inflammatory condition of the nipple and retroareolar region. This commonly results in localised sepsis with small abscesses, scarring and purulent drainage from the nipple. The nipple may be pulled in which can cause an inverted nipple. The problem with periductal mastitis is making the diagnosis.

Ductal ectasia and periductal mastitis are important, as many of the features caused by these conditions are similar to the changes found with cancer. Ductal ectasia may result in periductal mastitis.

4.-35 Who gets ductal ectasia and periductal mastitis?

Generally women in their 60s but much younger women may get the same changes.

### 4-36 What problems can be caused by ductal ectasia and periductal mastitis?

*	Discharge from the nipple: this is generally greenish and clear.
*	A lump under the areola. These may be fluid filled and tend to disappear.
*	An abscess next to the areola.
*	An inverted nipple.

### 4-37 What investigations should be done?

All women over 40 should have a mammogram and the fluid from the discharge should be sent off for cytology.

Most women will need to be sent to a breast unit for a diagnosis to be made as ductal ectasia and periductal mastitis may mimic breast cancer.

### 4-38 How should these women be treated?

The most important thing is to make an accurate diagnosis. The conditions themselves do not need to be treated but the complications must be correctly managed.

### 4-39 Is nipple inversion always abnormal?

No. Nipple inversion (turned or pulled inwards) is usually normal. It is only abnormal if a nipple used to be everted (sticking out) and becomes inverted. The commonest cause is ductal ectasia or periductal mastitis but a cancer can also cause nipple inversion.

> Ductal ectasia or periductal mastitis are common causes of nipple inversion but a cancer must be ruled out.

### 4-40 How should cracked nipples be managed?

This is very common in breastfeeding mothers. It may cause pain with breastfeeding and can result in mastitis or an abscess. A little breast milk should be left on the nipple at the end of each feed. The nipple must be kept dry between feeds. If it becomes a problem, antibiotic cream can be applied.

### 4-41 What is a keratin pearl?

A keratin pearl is a small yellow bead which appears on the nipple. This is very common and requires no treatment.

### 4-42 How is eczema of the nipple managed?

Eczema of the areola is very itchy and particularly common in women who have eczema elsewhere. It is important to distinguish it from Paget’s disease of the nipple which is a sign of cancer. Paget’s disease begins in the nipple and is associated with flattening of the nipple. To determine whether it is Paget’s disease or eczema a biopsy should be taken if it does not rapidly improve with steroid cream.

### 4-43 How is a biopsy of the areola or nipple performed?

Local anaesthetic is injected under the skin. If a punch biopsy is available, a small circle of full thickness skin should be biopsied.

If no punch biopsy is available, a 23G needle may be used to tent up a small area of skin so that is can be biopsied.

### 4-44 HIV infection

Women with HIV infection have an increased incidence of nipple and breast infections when breastfeeding.

### 4-45 What causes nipple pain?

This is particularly common in breastfeeding women or women around the time of menopause. In breastfeeding women, it may be caused by a cracked nipple or an infection. The commonest organisms causing infection are *Candida* or *Staphlococcus*. They should be treated with an antifungal or an antibacterial cream.

The cause of nipple pain around the time of menopause is not known and women should be reassured after they have had a normal mammogram. It is important to examine all women with nipple pain.

### 4-46 How should nipple polyps be managed?

A nipple polyp is an abnormal but non-cancerous growth from the wall of a duct. They are usually attached by a stalk. Nipple polyps are relatively common and may become a problem in breastfeeding mothers as they can lead to bleeding during feeding. If they are a problem, local anaesthetic can be injected into the nipple and they can be removed. Ideally this should be done after a woman has stopped breastfeeding.

## Nipple discharge

### 4-47 What questions should be asked if a woman has a nipple discharge?

*	Are you pregnant or breastfeeding?
*	What colour is the discharge?
*	Is the discharge thick or thin?
*	Is there a discharge from both nipples?
*	If only from one nipple, is it from a single place on the nipple or from more than one place? 
*	Does it come out without the breast being squeezed (i.e. spontaneous)?
*	Does it stain your clothes? This gives a good idea of the amount of discharge.

### 4-48 When is a nipple discharge worrying?

*	When it is spontaneous (occurs on its own without squeezing the nipple).
*	When it is bloody or blood stained.
*	When it is completely clear and colourless (looks like water).
*	When there is so much discharge a women has to wear breast pads.
*	When it is associated with a breast lump.
*	When it is from only one duct: Some women may have discharge from many ducts when they squeeze their nipple. If there is no blood, this can be entirely normal.
*	When it is new: after childbirth, some women will continue to have discharge for many years.

> When both a nipple discharge and a breast lump are present the lump must be investigated.

### 4-49 When is a nipple discharge normal?

One in five women can squeeze a small amount of fluid from the nipple. The discharge is usually either greenish in colour or thick (like toothpaste). This is normal and does not need to be investigated.

However, a discharge that occurs on its own without squeezing the nipple may not be normal especially if there are large amounts of discharge.

### 4-50 What type of fluid can be discharged?

Four types of fluid are commonly discharged from the nipple:

*	*Milky fluid*. This is normal around the time of breastfeeding. It may continue for a long time after breastfeeding has finished and is commonly from both breasts. If it is completely unrelated to pregnancy, a serum prolactin level should be done.
*	*Greenish or brownish fluid*. This is generally thin and is from more than one duct. It is abnormal if it leaks out of the nipple spontaneously and the woman has to wear a breast pad.
*	*Bloody fluid*. There is always a pathological cause for bloody discharge from the breast. Often, the cause is not cancerous but all women with a bloody discharge need a mammogram and, if possible, an ultrasound scan.
*	*Watery colourless fluid*. This should be treated the same as bloody fluid.

> A bloody nipple discharge is always abnormal.

### 4-51 What investigations should be done?

*	Greenish fluid that appears after squeezing the breast needs no investigation. Milky fluid also does not need testing.
*	Bloody fluid or watery fluid should be put on a slide and sent for cytology.
*	All women with bloody or watery fluid need a mammogram and an ultrasound scan.
*	If no lumps are found on mammogram or ultrasound scan, all women with a watery or bloody discharge should have a duct exploration.

### 4-52 What is the commonest cause of a greenish discharge?

Duct ectasia is the commonest cause of a thin or thick greenish discharge.

### 4-53 Why is a bloody or watery discharge a worry?

Because about 10% women with a bloody or watery discharge will have a cancer causing the discharge. This percentage is much higher if there is also a breast lump.

### 4-54 What is the commonest cause of a bloody discharge?

The commonest cause of a bloody discharge is an intraductal papilloma. The discharge is usually from one duct only.

### 4-55 What is an intraductal papilloma?

An intraductal papilloma is a growth in a duct. The closer the growth is to the nipple, the more likely it is to be non-cancerous. The further away from the nipple, the more likely it is to be a papillary cancer. All intraductal papillomas need a histological (tissue) diagnosis. This usually means removal of the papilloma.

An intraductal papilloma generally presents with bleeding from a single duct.

## Infections of the breast

### 4-56 What causes infections of the breast?

They may be caused by any of the following:

*	An associated condition or abnormality in the breast
*	An abnormality in the immune system
*	A particular pathogen (organism causing the infection)

### 4-57 What are the commonest associated problems in the breast which may lead to breast infections?

*	Breast infections are much commoner in women who are breastfeeding.
*	Cancer: occasionally a cancer may cause a blockage which then leads to an infection. Inflammatory breast cancer may mimic a breast infection. A fungating cancer may become infected.
*	Duct ectasia and periductal mastitis: Fluid may leak from the ducts into the surrounding tissue and cause areas of inflammation followed by infection. This can result in an abscess.
*	Radiation: This is a rare cause of infection. Radiation may cause necrotic tissue that may become secondarily infected.
*	Implanted breast prostheses: infection may occur shortly after surgery.

Abscesses near the areola area may be seen in smokers and may cause a fistula. These women are generally in their 30s. Abscesses throughout the breast may open in different areas and tend to be seen in slightly older women.

### 4-58 What are the commonest immune system causes?

*	Diabetes: all non-breastfeeding women with a breast infection should be tested for diabetes.
*	HIV infection.

### 4-59 What pathogens cause breast abscesses?

*	*Staphylococcus aureus* is generally the cause of breastfeeding abscesses. It is often seen in abscesses caused by ductal ectasia but many other bacteria can be involved.
*	Tuberculosis: this is relatively common in TB endemic areas and occurs in non-HIV-positive patients, as well as HIV-positive patients. The diagnosis must be made and they should be treated for TB systemically.
*	Syphilis: this may be seen in areas where syphilis is common.
*	Filaria: this may be seen in some parts of the world but not generally in South Africa.
*	*Candida*: seen in breastfeeding mothers.

> Always look for a cause when a woman has a breast infection.

### 4-60 What questions should be asked about an infection in the breast?

*	Are you breastfeeding or pregnant?
*	Are you HIV positive?
*	Are you diabetic?
*	Are you a smoker?
*	Have you had this before?
*	How long has the infection been present?
*	Has the appearance of the infection changed since it started?
*	Have you had any breast operations?

### 4-61 What is an abscess?

An abscess is a collection of pus. Clinically, an abscess has overlying red shiny skin and has a soft fluctuant feel to it. If the abscess is deep, it may be hard and tender. Sometimes, it drains spontaneously and the patient presents with pus draining from the abscess.

As blood cannot get into the centre of a pus collection, antibiotics alone are not enough. Therefore the pus must be drained either by an incision and drainage or by using a 14G needle and aspirating the pus under local anaesthetic. This is better done under ultrasound guidance. Antibiotic cover should be given if the abcess is aspirated. Use a broad spectrum antibiotic because often more than one type of bacteria is present.

### 4-62 What is the further management of a breast abscess after drainage?

The patient should be given an oral broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as augmentin, and seen again in 10 days time. A simple infection should have resolved by then and a mammogram can now be done if the patient is older than 40 years. An ultrasound scan should be done in younger women.

It is less painful for the woman to have a mammogram once the infection has cleared and the result is easier to interpret.

### 4-63 What is the difference between mastitis and an abscess?

Mastitis is infection of the breast without pus formation. An abscess is an infection with pus formation. Mastitis may be treated with antibiotics but may go on to become an abscess.

### 4-64 Can breast cancer present like a breast infection?

Yes. Inflammatory breast cancer can present with the signs and symptoms of a breast infection.

> Inflammatory breast cancer can mimic a breast infection.

### 4-65 What other conditions seen on a mammogram may mimic breast cancer?

Some non-cancerous conditions can look like a cancer on a mammogram. These cause a lot of anxiety and need a biopsy:

*	A radial scar and a complex sclerosing lesion are two benign changes that look like cancers. They are of no significance but a diagnosis must be made.
*	Fat necrosis is due to an injury causing death of a small amount of fatty tissue. This may appear on the mammogram or ultrasound scan or may present as a lump. On aspiration, the lump is filled with oily material. There must be a cause for fat necrosis: bruise on the breast, surgery or radiation. A history of a ‘bump’ on the breast is not enough.

### 4-66 What is meant by a lumpy breast?

This is a term used so commonly that it has become almost meaningless. Some women do have very firm dense breasts. Others have much softer breasts. In general, the younger the women, the denser the breasts. However, some older women have firm lumpy breasts. They generally have fibrocystic change.

### 4-67 Which benign changes are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer?

Before the formation of breast cancer, the breast becomes more hyperplastic (the cells are busier and multiply faster). This may lead to areas of atypical hyperplasia. In the next module, it can be seen how atypical hyperplasia may develop into ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and then into invasive breast cancer.

Older women who develop a new fibroadenoma should be considered to be at increased risk of cancer.

## Case study 1

A 30 year old woman with a breast lump is referred for an ultrasound scan and a mammogram. Both show the typical features of a fibroadenoma.

### 1. What is a fibroadenoma?

It is an area of breast tissue consisting of both fibrous and glandular tissue.

### 2. Is it malignant?

No, it is benign and a common aberration of normal development and involution (ANDI).

### 3. What does a fibroadenoma feel like on palpation?

It is firm and very mobile. Most fibroadenomas are less than 3 cm in size.

### 4. At what age are fibroadenomas common?

The majority of women who develop a fibroadenoma are under the age of 35 years.

### 5. How should this woman be managed?

An ultrasound scan and a fine needle aspiration should be done for cytology. Reassurance alone is all that is needed if the clinical examination, imaging and cytology all suggest a fibroadenoma. If the diagnosis is still uncertain a core biopsy is needed.

## Case study 2

A 49 year old woman visits a district hospital as she has found a breast lump. She is very anxious as her mother died of breast cancer. A mammogram and ultrasound scan show a typical simple cyst. The medical officer aspirates green fluid from the cyst.

### 1. What is a cyst?

Cysts are benign (non-cancerous) lumps in the breast that are filled with fluid. They are common in women in their 40s.

### 2. Is the cyst likely to be malignant?

No, as green fluid is typically aspirated from a benign cyst.

### 3. What should be done if the fluid was bloody?

It should be sent for cytology as bloody fluid suggests that the cyst may be malignant.

### 4. What further treatment is needed?

If the cyst has been fully aspirated it will probably disappear. As the scans were normal and the fluid not bloody she can be reassured that she does not have cancer.

### 5. What would happen if the cyst was not aspirated?

It would slowly disappear on its own.

### 6. What is the cause of simple breast cysts?

Cysts form when glandular tissue shrinks in older women.

## Case study 3

A woman aged 42 complains of tender, painful breasts especially in the day before her menstrual period starts. On clinical examination her breasts are normal. She asks whether it is normal to have painful breasts as she has not had this problem before.

### 1. What is the probable cause of her painful breasts?

Mastalgia. The pain is typically worse in the days before a menstrual period and disappears when the period starts.

### 2. Is this condition common?

Yes. Most women will have painful breasts at some stage of their lives.

### 3. Where in the breasts does the pain usually occur?

In the upper quadrant as this is where most of the breast tissue is found.

### 4. What is the correct management?

The pain and tenderness are often much less if the woman wears a bra which fits correctly.

### 5. Should she have a mammogram?

Yes. All women over 40 years with any breast complaint should have a mammogram. A normal result will reassure her that the pain is not due to cancer.

## Case study 4

A 45 year old woman presents with discharge from her nipple. She first noticed the discharge 2 years ago. It has not changed and is only there when she squeezes her breast. Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 44 years old.

### 1. What are the important points to look for when her breast is examined?

Both breasts must be carefully examined and a lump must be excluded. Look for nipple inversion. The nipple should be squeezed gently (the patient can be asked to do it) and any discharge should be inspected. Note whether any discharge is from a single duct or multiple ducts. Note what colour the discharge is. 

### 2. What investigations should the woman be sent for?

A mammogram. The woman is over 40 years old and she has a family history of breast cancer. If the mammogram is normal, the discharge greenish and from more than one duct, and there are no lumps, she can be reassured. Otherwise she should be investigated further.

### 3. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Ductal ectasia is the most likely diagnosis as the discharge has been there for 2 years and has not increased. With ductal ectasia the discharge is usually green and can be thick or thin.

### 4. Is she more likely to develop breast cancer as a result of having a discharge?

Not if the diagnosis is ductal ectasia.

# Cancer of the breast

## Objectives

When you have completed this chapter you should be able to:

*	Name the different types of breast cancer.
*	Understand the concept of grading and hormonal status.
*	Understand staging.
*	Know how breast cancer is usually diagnosed.

## Case study 1

A 60 year old woman presents with a 2 cm mass in one of her breasts. Her mammogram shows a lump which looks malignant and her cytology also suggests a malignancy. She has no lymph nodes palpable in her axilla. Core biopsy shows a grade 1 ductal carcinoma. It is found to be ER positive. Her chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound are normal.

1.	What stage is her cancer?
2.	What does grade 1 mean?

4.	Are you surprised that the cells are ER +ve?
5.	Why is it important to know if a breast cancer is ER +ve?
6.	What are HER2 receptors?

## Case study 2

A 42 year old obese mother of two young children presents with a bloody nipple discharge. On examination she has a large mass in her right breast. She has enlarged lymph nodes in her right axilla. The rest of her general examination is normal. A core biopsy is done and a diagnosis of breast cancer is made.

## Introduction to breast cancer

### 5-1 What is cancer?

Cancer is a disease caused by cells that can multiply uncontrollably and then break off and spread both locally and beyond the breast to other areas of the body (metastasize). There are many types of cancer. Cancer can originate from many organs in the body.

> Cancer is a disease caused by cells which multiply uncontrollably and can break off to spread to different sites in the body.

Note
:	Other words that are used to indicate that a lump is cancerous: carcinoma, malignant, neoplastic and non-benign.

Cancer implies an invasive lump. It is confusing as the terms ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ are non-invasive forms of cancer. Whenever cancer is used in this text, it refers to invasive cancer.

### 5-2 Is breast cancer always a primary cancer?

Over 99% of the time a breast cancer is a primary cancer. This means that it starts in the breast and has not spread to the breast from other parts of the body.

### 5-3 Where does the breast cancer start?

The commonest type of breast cancer starts in the ducts. Other types start in the lobes and rarely in the tissue in between.

> The commonest type of breast cancer starts in the ducts.

### 5-4 Is there a stage before breast cancer?

Yes: It is called carcinoma in situ.

The commonest form is ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS. This means that the malignant cells are still in the ducts and have not yet moved into the surrounding breast tissue. It is therefore not an invasive cancer yet. 

Ductal carcinoma in situ will progress to invasive cancer over time as the malignant cells break through the wall of the duct and then spread into the surrounding fatty tissue. Therefore this invasive cancer will form in the area of the DCIS.

> Over time ductal carcinoma in situ (DCS) will become an invasive ductal cancer.

Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is very complicated and far less common. If LCIS is found anywhere in either breast, it means the woman is more likely to develop a breast cancer at some stage in her life although it may not actually be in the same place where the LCIS has formed.

### 5-5 Are there any non-cancerous conditions associated with an increased risk of breast cancer?

Yes:

*	Atypical ductal hyperplasia. This means that ductal cells are multiplying much faster than usual but have not yet become a carcinoma in situ as shown in the picture above. Sometimes only atypical duct hyperplasia will be seen if a ductal carcinoma in situ or a cancer has been missed with the biopsy.
*	A new fibroadenoma which develops in a woman over 40 years. This implies that her breasts are more proliferative (busier) than they should be.

### 5-6 What are the risk factors that increase the chance of getting a breast cancer?

In 90% of cases, the cause for a woman developing breast cancer is unknown. There are, however, a number of known risk factors:

*	Gender: women are a 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer than men.
*	Age: the older a women, the more likely she is to get breast cancer
*	Family history: 5% of women have a gene abnormality (BRCA 1 or 2 mutation). They have a 50-85% risk of developing a breast cancer.
*	Previous radiotherapy to the chest wall: patients who have had radiation for a lymphoma have an increased chance of breast cancer.
*	Personal history of breast cancer. If a woman has had one breast cancer, she is at a higher risk than normal of developing another breast cancer.
*	Living in a first world country.
*	Having a personal history of having had atypical ductal hyperplasia or a new fibroadenoma over the age of 40.

> In 90% of cases the cause of breast cancer is unknown.

### 5-7 How common is breast cancer in the general population?

It depends which population is being referred to. In a western population, the lifetime incidence is 1:9 (12%). In the developing world, it is much lower. This difference is partly due to the fact women in the western world live longer than those in developing countries. However, that is not the whole story and further research is necessary to explain the difference.

Numbers in South Africa are inaccurate but the incidence is quoted as being 1:29. This is set to increase as women are living longer.

Breast and cervical cancer are the two commonest forms of cancer in women.

> The incidence of breast cancer in South Africa is expected to increase as women live longer.

### 5-8 How does breast cancer spread beyond the breast?

Breast cancer can spread via the lymphatic system to the local lymph nodes and also via the blood system to distant organs. Usually it spreads to the lymph nodes under the arm first (axillary lymph nodes).

> Breast cancer usually spreads to the axillary lymph nodes first.

If the breast cancer cells are spread via the blood stream, they will follow the blood flow from the breast to the next organ or be trapped where the blood vessels become narrow. In practice, this means the lungs, liver, bone or brain. Cancer cells may go to the brain.

### 5-9 What makes a cancer more likely to spread?

The behaviour of a breast cancer is dependent on how ‘sticky’ the cells are which determines how strongly they remain attached to each other. Cells that are less ‘sticky’ tend to break off and spread.

### 5-10 Do all cancers behave in the same way?

No. Breast cancer describes many different diseases and that is what makes the understanding and the treatment both difficult and interesting. Some cancers are slow growing and tend to cause problems locally with ulceration in the breast and don’t really spread beyond the breast. Other cancers are fast growing and although they are still small, cells break off and travel to either the lymph nodes or to a distant organ.

### 5-11 What does prognosis mean?

Prognosis is the probable outcome for a person with a particular disease, i.e. the natural history of the disease without treatment. A good prognosis means the patient will probably remain well. Good prognostic factors for breast cancer are:

*	Size of primary (the smaller the better).
*	The nodal status (if it has not spread to the nodes, the prognosis is better).
*	The grade (the lower the grade the better).
*	The receptor status: ER +ve (ER positive) tumours do better than ER −ve (ER negative). In contrast HER2 +ve tumours do worse than HER2 −ve tumours.
*	The metastatic status (i.e. whether the disease has spread around the body); a cancer that has metastasized (spread to other organs) does worse than a tumour that is still in the breast and lymph node.
*	Lymphovascular invasion (spread into the lymphatics and blood stream even if there are no clinical metastases yet).
*	The response to treatment.

Most women with breast cancer get treated so the outcome depends on the response to treatment, as well as the natural history of the disease.

> The prognosis is affected by the natural history of the disease and the response to treatment.

### 5-12 What does the grade mean?

The grade of the cancer describes how active (‘busy’ or aggressive) a cancer is and how ‘cohesive’ (sticky) the cells are. The higher the grade, the faster the cells are multiplying and the less cohesive the cells are. The faster the cancer grows the more likely it is to metastasize if treatment is not given. Breast cancer is graded from 1 to 3 with grade 1 being the least aggressive and 3 the most aggressive. The lower the grade the better the prognosis. 

> The grade of a cancer indicates the risk of it spreading.

### 5-13 What does the stage mean?

The stage describes:

*	The size of the cancer
*	Whether it has spread to the lymph nodes
*	Whether it has spread to other parts of the body

Therefore staging is based on the size of the primary tumour in the breast (T), the spread to the nodes (N) and whether it has spread (metastasized) via the blood stream (M).

There are 4 stages of breast cancer with stage 1 describing early cancer (small tumour with no spread to nodes or other organs) and stage 4 describing advanced cancer that has spread around the body. The earlier the stage, the better the prognosis.

> The stage of a breast cancer indicates whether a cancer has spread and, if so, how far it has spread.

### 5-14 What does hormone receptor status mean?

Most cells in the body have receptors on their surface to which specific hormones can attach. Hormones are chemicals that circulate in the blood stream and can change the behaviour of a cell far away from the gland where the hormone is produced. Normal breast cells have receptors for both the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. This allows the behaviour of cells in the normal breast to be altered at different times of the menstrual cycle and also during pregnancy.

Cancer cells may or may not have receptors to estrogen and progesterone. If they have receptors they are called ER/PR positive cancers. (Estrogen/Progesterone sensitive cancers). The most important receptor is the ER receptor. Cells with estrogen receptors are called ER +ve.

Note
:	The lower the grade, of cancer, the more likely it is to have hormone receptors. Nearly all grade 1 cancers are ER +ve. 

Cancers that are ER +ve have a better prognosis than those that are ER −ve and more importantly, the receptor which is present on some breast cancer cells allows hormone treatment to be used for the cancer.

> ER positive cancers have a better prognosis.

### 5-15 What other receptors may cancers cells have?

Aggressive cancers may have a HER2 receptor which will allow treatment with Herceptin. This is the only other receptor that is being used commonly for treatment at the moment. Treatment with Herceptin is known as targeted therapy.

Many drug companies are looking for other receptors which will allow new drugs to act on the cancer cells.

Note
:	HER2 stands for human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2. If present it allows the growth factor to attach and stimulate rapid cell multiplication making the tumour more aggressive.

### 5-16 Does a cancer start in one place in the breast only?

Cancers may be single or may be multifocal (multicentric). Mutifocal means that there is more than one cancer in a single breast.

### 5-17 What change does normal breast tissue go through before a breast cancer develops?

This is controversial but there are different changes that occur before the development of a breast cancer. Often, atypical hyperplasia progresses to ductal carcinoma in situ and then cancer. However, more recent research has shown that cancers do not always follow a clear-cut path.

## Types of breast cancer

### 5-18 What types of breast cancer are there?

There are 2 common types of breast cancer:

*	Ductal
*	Lobular

There are also other less common types:

*	Inflammatory
*	Tubular
*	Papillary
*	Colloid
*	Mucinous

> Ductal and lobular are the commonest types of breast cancer.

Although there are different types of breast cancer, the treatment principles remain similar.

### 5-19 What is ductal cancer?

Ductal cancer is the common type of breast cancer and accounts for about 65% of all the cancers seen. It starts in the ducts. Ductal cancer can be low grade and slow growing or high grade and highly aggressive.

> Ductal cancer can be either low or high grade.

### 5-20 What is lobular cancer?

Lobular carcinoma starts in the lobes (lobules) and is nearly always low grade. It can be difficult to diagnose as the cancer sometimes is not seen on mammograms while on cytology it can look like normal breast tissue.

> Lobular cancer is nearly always low grade but can be difficult to diagnose.

### 5-21 What is inflammatory cancer?

Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive type of cancer that presents with redness and swelling of the breast. There is always lymph node involvement and unless the patient is very fat, a lymph node will be felt. The typical history is that a woman noticed that her breast is red. It is not generally painful which helps distinguish it from an infection.

## Clinical presentation of breast cancer

### 5-22 What factors in the clinical assessment would point to a diagnosis of breast cancer?

History:

*	Age: the older the woman, the more likely it is to be breast cancer
*	Family history of breast cancer particularly if the relatives were younger than 40 at the time of diagnosis or if there are many relatives with breast cancer
*	Family history of other cancers, particularly prostate or ovarian cancer
*	History of a lump either under the arm or in the breast. The lump is generally painless.
*	Bloody discharge from the nipple
*	Change in the nipple appearance: Paget’s disease of the nipple

Examination:

*	A lump that is not clearly defined. It may feel like a thickening. However, some cancers can feel well defined like cysts or fibroadenomas.
*	Thickening of the breast
*	Skin dimpling
*	Redness of the skin
*	*Peau d’orange* skin changes (due to skin oedema)
*	Nipple changes: either bloody discharge, inversion of the nipple or Paget’s disease (looks like eczema)

*Peau d’orange* means skin of an orange. If present, the skin over the breast has obvious indentations which is due to alteration in lymphatic flow.

(Paget’s disease is the name given to changes in the nipple which are a sign of breast cancer. These nipple changes may look like eczema. To start with, the nipple appears dry and flaky. Later, the nipple becomes flatter and may ulcerate. The only reliable way to tell the difference between eczema and Paget’s disease is to do a biopsy. The name Paget’s disease is confusing as it is not a separate disease or different kind of cancer. It is an uncommon sign of cancer.)

## Imaging changes in breast cancer

### 5-23 What does breast cancer look like on a mammogram?

A mammogram is nearly always done if a cancer is suspected. Cancers are white on a mammogram and may have malignant microcalcifications (small specks of calcium). It is important to do a mammogram to look at the rest of the breast. It should give an indication as to whether a cancer is single or multifocal.

> A cancer usually looks white on a mammogram.

### 5-24 Are mammograms always reliable?

No. About 15% of cancers are not seen on a mammogram.

> 15% of cancers are not seen on a mammogram.

### 5-25 When is a mammogram unreliable in diagnosing breast cancer?

Mammography is especially unreliable in:

*	Young women
*	Women with dense breasts
*	Women with prostheses
*	Women with lobular cancer

In some cases, the primary cancer does not show up clearly (e.g. in inflammatory cancer) but the malignant lymph node does show up.

### 5-26 What does breast cancer look like on an ultrasound?

Cancers may appear on ultrasound as a black irregular mass. An ultrasound should be done if a woman has a palpable mass but a normal mammogram or if the breasts are dense. Ultrasound should be the first imaging done on a young woman under 35 years of age.

### 5-27 What changes are seen on cytology?

The cancer cells look abnormal with little cytoplasm and large abnormal nuclei when compared to normal cells (see figure 3-8).

### 5-28 What should be done once the diagnosis of breast cancer is made?

The stage of the cancer must be decided upon. This will need further investigations to look for spread via the blood stream to other organs. Staging is important because it helps to determine both treatment and outcome.

### 5-29 To which organs does breast cancer spread?

The commonest places for breast cancer to spread to are the:

*	Liver
*	Lungs
*	Bones

If a woman has any symptoms that may suggest spread (e.g. cough or bony pain) she should have appropriate tests.

For most women with breast cancer, they should have at least a chest X-ray and ultrasound of their liver. CT scans and bone scans are not generally done unless the risk of spread is higher, when the cancer is locally advanced or there are lots of nodes involved.

### 5-30 What must be known about the breast cancer before deciding on the appropriate treatment?

A full description of the breast cancer is needed:

*	What type of cancer does the women have
*	What is the size of the primary tumour (the lump in the breast)
*	Whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes
*	Whether the cancer has spread to the rest of the body

> A detailed assessment of the breast cancer is needed before deciding on appropriate treatment.

## Case study 1

A 60 year old woman presents with a 2 cm mass in one of her breasts. Her mammogram shows a lump, which looks malignant, and her cytology also suggests a malignancy. She has no lymph nodes palpable in her axilla. Core biopsy shows a grade 1 ductal carcinoma. It is found to be ER positive. Her chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound are normal.

### 1. What stage is her cancer?

She has a stage 1 cancer as it is small and has not spread to the lymph nodes or via the blood stream to other parts of the body.

### 2. What does grade 1 mean?

Grade 1 means that this is a slow growing, non-aggressive tumour. It has probably taken years to reach the size of 2 cm.

### 3. What does ER +ve mean?

It means that there are estrogen receptors on the cancer cells.

### 4. Are you surprised that the cells are ER +ve?

No, as nearly all grade 1 cancers are ER +ve.

### 5. Why is it important to know if a breast cancer is ER +ve?

Because these cancers respond well to hormonal treatment.

### 6. What are HER2 receptors?

Receptors to Herceptin on the cancer cells. If they are present target therapy can be used.

## Case study 2

A 42 year old obese mother of two young children presents with a bloody nipple discharge. On examination she has a large mass in her right breast. She has enlarged lymph nodes in her right axilla. The rest of her general examination is normal. A core biopsy is done and diagnosis of breast cancer is made.

### 1. What stage is her cancer?

At least stage 2 or 3 as she has a large tumour with spread to the local lymph nodes. It would be stage 4 if the cancer has spread via the blood stream to other organs.

### 2. What organs are likely to have metastases?

Lung, liver, bones and brain.

### 3. What staging investigations should she have?

A chest X-ray and an ultrasound scan of her liver. In some centres, she would be sent for a CT scan.

### 4. What are prognostic factors?

Prognostic factors are characteristics about the cancer that will give some indication as to how good the outcome is likely to be.

### 5. Which are good prognostic factors?

*	A small tumour
*	No lymph node involvement
*	A low-grade cancer
*	Receptor status ER +ve
*	No metastases
*	Good response to treatment

## Case study 3

A 40 year old woman notices that she has a small lump in her breast that does not disappear after her menstrual period. Following an ultrasound scan she has a core biopsy which shows a ductal carcinoma in situ.

### 1. What is ductal carcinoma in situ?

Malignant cells which have not yet spread beyond the walls of the duct. This is a common form of carcinoma. It is often referred to as DCIS. 

### 2. Are there other forms of carcinoma in situ?

Lobular carcinoma in situ or LCIS.

### 3. What will happen if ductal carcinoma in situ is not treated?

It will become an invasive ductal cancer.

### 4. Are there other conditions which are associated with an increased risk of cancer?

*	Atypical ductal hyperplasia
*	A new fibroadenoma in a woman over 40 years of age

### 5. What other investigations should she have?

She needs a mammogram as DCIS shows up much better on a mammogram than on an ultrasound scan.

## Case study 4

An elderly woman presents with a red, swollen breast and *peau d’orange* skin changes. She also has what appears to be an inverted nipple on that side. On examination she has a large breast lump with enlarged lymph nodes in her axilla. Her other breast is normal but her liver is enlarged and she has severe back pain.

### 1. What is the diagnosis?

She almost certainly has breast cancer. Her enlarged liver and back pain suggests that she already has metastases.

### 2. What are *peau d’orange* skin changes?

The skin over the tumour becomes oedematous and looks like the skin of an orange.

### 3. What is the problem with her nipple?

She probably has cancer behind her nipple causing inversion.

### 4. What type of breast cancer is this likely to be?

Inflammatory breast cancer.

# Treatment of breast cancer

## Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

*	Understand the principles of different treatment methods.
*	Know the difference between neoadjuvant therapy and adjuvant therapy.
*	Understand the different possibilities for breast and axillary surgery.
*	Understand when chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy and radiotherapy are used.

## Case study 1

A young premenopausal woman with small breasts presents with a small breast cancer. She is unmarried and worried that treatment will leave her disfigured. After discussion by a multidisciplinary team she is offered a choice of local and systemic management.

1.	What does local management mean?
2.	What local treatments are available?
3.	What is systemic management?
4.	What types of systemic treatment can be used?

## Case study 2

A 45 year old mother of two children has a breast lump found on a mammogram. A diagnosis of cancer is confirmed on histology. Examination of the other breast and both axillae is normal. She chooses to have surgery and a sentinel node biopsy is found to be positive. She is offered adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery.

1.	What is a sentinel node biopsy?
2.	What is an axillary clearance?
3.	What are the complications of axillary node clearance?
4.	What is adjuvant radiotherapy?

## Case study 3

A 55 year old postmenopausal woman presents with a 2 cm ductal carcinoma in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast. It shows up on the mammogram and there are no other masses. There are no nodes that can be seen on ultrasound scan or felt in her armpit. The cancer is ER +ve.

1.	Would she be suitable for a wide local excision if that was her preference?
2.	Will she be advised to have hormone therapy?
3.	Is she suitable for an aromatase inhibitor?
4.	How do these drugs work?

## Case study 4

1.	What is neoadjuvant chemotherapy?
2.	How does this differ from adjuvant chemotherapy?
3.	Will she be advised to have an aromatase inhibitor?
4.	If it is available to her, would she be advised to have Herceptin?

## Introduction to breast cancer treatment

### 6-1 What is the aim of treatment?

To prolong life and wherever possible cure the patient. This is done by:

1.	Treating the primary (local) breast tumour
2.	Assessing whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes
3.	Removing any lymph nodes that have cancer
4.	Preventing systemic spread of the cancer via the blood stream to other parts of the body.

> The aim of breast cancer treatment is to prolong life and cure the patient whenever possible.

### 6-2 What types of management are available for treating breast cancer?

There are two types (modalities or methods) of management:

*	Local management
*	Systemic management

### 6-3 What does local management mean?

Local management describes treatment to the breast and the axilla (armpit).

### 6-4 What types of local management are available?

*	Surgery
*	Radiation

### 6-5 What does systemic management mean?

Systemic management is treatment to the whole body. It must be remembered that systemic management can also treat the primary (local) breast cancer.

### 6-6 What types of systemic management are available?

*	Hormone (endocrine) therapy
*	Chemotherapy
*	Targeted therapy

### 6-7 What factors should be taken into account when deciding on which type of treatment to use?

1.	The stage of the cancer:
	*	If the cancer is very early, surgery is the most effective treatment.
	*	If the cancer has already spread around the body then systemic treatment is the most important. Additional local treatment may be advised in certain circumstances.
2.	The patient herself:
	*	Her general fitness
	*	Her preference
3.	The type of cancer:
	*	More aggressive cancers (grade 3) will be treated with chemotherapy
	*	Endocrine therapy should only be used for ER +ve cancers
	*	Herceptin should only be given to HER2 +ve cancers
4.	The individual preference of the doctors
5.	Local availability of treatment options

> The earlier the stage of breast cancer, the more important surgery is.

### 6-8 In what order are the different types of treatment given?

Traditionally, if surgery is going to be done, it is the first treatment carried out. However, over the last decade, that has changed. Systemic treatment may now be given before the surgery or after surgery depending on factors in each patient.

### 6-9 What does neoadjuvant therapy mean?

Neoadjuvant therapy is systemic treatment which is given before surgery. In most cases this means chemotherapy given before surgery. Herceptin and hormone therapy can also be given as neoadjuvant therapy before surgery.

> Neoadjuvant therapy is systemic treatment which is given before surgery.

### 6-10 What are the advantages of neoadjuvant therapy?

There are some advantages:

*	The primary cancer can be used as an ‘index cancer’ to judge the response to treatment, i.e. how it responds to neoadjuvant therapy.
*	It may allow the type of surgery that is planned to be changed. For example, a large cancer can be reduced in size by chemotherapy making a wide local excision possible rather than a mastectomy.

Therefore neoadjuvant therapy helps to make the surgery easier or more successful.

### 6-11 What does adjuvant therapy mean?

Adjuvant therapy is generally given after surgery. It is treatment given ‘in case’ the surgery has not removed all the cancer cells when there is no clinical evidence of spread of cancer cells beyond the primary tumour. The aim is to increase the chance of long-term survival. Adjuvant therapy may include:

*	Chemotherapy
*	Radiotherapy
*	Hormonal (endocrine) therapy
*	Targeted therapy with Herceptin

> The aim of adjuvant therapy is to improve the chance of long-term survival.

### 6-12 What are the advantages of doing surgery first?

The advantage of doing surgery first is that a lot more in known about the tumour before any treatment is started. The whole cancer can be seen and the lymph node involvement can be accurately assessed.

## Surgery in breast cancer treatment

### 6-13 What surgery is done?

Surgery is done on the breast and on the axillary nodes. Although some names for operations include both the axilla and the breast, they will be considered separately here.

### 6-14 What does oncoplastic surgery mean?

Onco (cancer) plastic (aesthetic) surgery is the term used to describe doing a breast cancer operation and leaving the most acceptable breast shape possible and minimising the asymmetry.

Aesthetic means acceptable or pleasing. The management of the cancer must ALWAYS come before the aesthetic appearance.

### 6-15 Surgery for the primary tumour of the breast

The operations for the primary tumour in the breast fall into 2 types:

*	Wide local excision
*	Mastectomy

> Surgery to the breast is either wide local excision or mastectomy.

### 6-16 What other terms are used for a wide local excision?

Wide local excision is sometimes referred to as:

*	Breast conservation therapy 
*	Lumpectomy 
*	Tumourectomy 
*	Quadrentectomy
*	Partial mastectomy 

Although terms may differ slightly, they basically mean the same thing.

### 6-17 What is a wide local excision?

Wide local excision (WLE) is the removal of the cancer with a margin of normal breast tissue around the cancer. The margins of the tumour MUST be clear of any disease, i.e. there must be no cancer cells in the tissue removed around the cancer. With wide local excision it is hoped that all the tumour has been removed.

### 6-18 What are the problems with wide local excision?

Problems are:

*	Some women will have a higher rate of recurrence than if they had a mastectomy.
*	Radiotherapy has to be given post­operatively.
*	The breasts may be very lopsided (not the same size and shape after surgery).
*	The asymmetry increases with age (only the normal breast will continue to get bigger).

### 6-19 What are the advantages of wide local excision?

Advantages are:

*	The woman keeps her breast.
*	The nipple can often be kept.

## Mastectomy

### 6-20 What is a mastectomy?

A mastectomy is removal of all the breast tissue.

> With a mastectomy all the breast tissue is removed.

### 6-21 Who should be advised to have a mastectomy rather than a wide local excision?

There are cancer (oncological), individual and cosmetic reasons:

1.	Cancer reasons for mastectomy:
	*	Multicentricity: If the cancer starts from more than one area in the breast, there is a higher rate of recurrence if a wide local excision is done.
	*	Widespread ductal carcinoma in situ (a large area of precancer).
	*	Multicentric ductal carcinoma in situ (precancer at a number of different places).
	*	Woman under 35 tend to do better with a mastectomy. A mastectomy lowers their risk of having another breast cancer or having a recurrence.
	*	Strong family history: If there is a strong family history, the woman has a higher chance of developing another breast cancer.
	*	Cancers bigger than 5 cm.
	*	Cancers that are not seen on mammogram or ultrasound scan. If the primary cancer is not seen, there may be other cancers within the breast that are also not seen.
2.	Individual reasons for mastectomy:
	*	A woman is unable to have radiotherapy postoperatively. There are many reasons for this but the commonest is that she has already had radiotherapy for another cancer, e.g. lymphoma.
	*	Patient preference. Some women feel safer with a mastectomy while others choose a mastectomy to avoid radiotherapy.
3.	Cosmetic reasons:
	*	What affects the cosmetic outcome more than anything after a wide local excision is the amount of tissue removed from the breast. If more than 20% of the breast is removed, there will be obvious asymmetry unless tissue is also removed from the opposite breast (breast reduction)
	*	If the cancer is under the areola, it will have to be removed if a wide local excision is done

### 6-22 What types of mastectomy are there?

There are a number of different types of mastectomy. The names given to these different types of mastectomy are confusing:

*	*Skin-sparing mastectomy*: all the breast tissue is removed but the skin overlying the breast is kept. This is only done if a reconstruction is being performed at the same time as the mastectomy.
*	*Skin-reducing mastectomy*: the breast tissue is removed together with the overlying skin. The woman is left with a flat chest.
*	*Nipple-sparing mastectomy*: the skin and the nipple are left but the underlying breast tissue is removed. This is only done when there is a planned reconstruction.
*	*Simple mastectomy*: removal of the breast tissue and no operation on the lymph nodes.
*	*Radical mastectomy*: this is the original operation done in the 1950s and should not be performed anymore as it is a disfiguring operation. The breast was removed together with the overlying skin and the underlying muscle (pectoralis major).
*	*Modified radical mastectomy*: this describes a simple mastectomy with removal of the lymph nodes as well but the underlying muscle is not removed.

### 6-23 How painful is a mastectomy?

A mastectomy without reconstruction (simple mastectomy) is not a physically painful operation but can be psychologically challenging. The operation for the lymph nodes is generally more painful. Reconstructive surgery can be painful.

## Breast reconstruction after mastectomy

### 6-24 Who should have a reconstruction?

Generally, it is a woman’s choice. 

### 6-25 When are breast reconstructions done?

They can be immediate, delayed or started with an expander at the time of surgery. Many women decide to have no reconstruction initially. However, they may want a reconstruction later:

*	*Immediate reconstruction*: this is done at the time of the cancer surgery.
*	*Delayed reconstruction*: initially a skin-reducing mastectomy is performed. All cancer management is finished (this may include radiotherapy) and then a reconstruction is started from scratch sometime later.
*	*Expander placement*: at the time of the cancer surgery, an expander may be placed under the muscle or skin. The skin is then gradually stretched up over the next few months and the final surgery is done when all cancer treatment has finished. This allows some skin to be removed at the time of surgery and eventually, the reconstruction is done using the chest wall skin.

### 6-26 What types of reconstruction are there?

There are two types of reconstruction:

1.	Autologous reconstructions which use the patient’s own tissues:
	*	Abdominal fat can be used: Transverse Rectus Abdominus Myocutaneous (TRAM) flap uses the fat from the abdomen to make a new breast. If microsurgery is used, it is called a Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap.
	*	Muscle can be used. The Latissimus Dorsi (LD) flap uses the muscle from the women’s back to create a new breast.
2.	Prosthetic reconstructions using a silicone prosthesis.

## Axillary surgery

### 6-27 What types of operations are done on the axilla (armpit)?

*	Removal of the lymph nodes. A few may be removed or a lot may be removed. Removing many lymph nodes is called an axillary node clearance.
*	Testing of the lymph nodes: sentinel lymph node biopsy.

### 6-28 Who should have their lymph nodes removed?

In general, if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, they need to be removed.

### 6-29 What are the problems of removing lymph nodes?

The more lymph nodes that are removed, the more complications are likely to occur:

*	Numbness down the arm. A nerve that supplies sensation to the inside of the arm is damaged if all the nodes are removed
*	Swelling of the arm (lymphoedema)
*	Seroma (build up of fluid in the axilla)

> Axillary clearance may lead to complications such as lymphoedema.

### 6-30 What is a sentinel lymph node biopsy?

The whole breast first drains to between one and three lymph nodes in the axilla: these are called the sentinel nodes. A sentinel lymph node biopsy is therefore a biopsy of the first lymph nodes to which cancer cells in the breast will spread. If there are no cancer cells in these nodes then it can be assumed there is no spread of cancer to the lymph nodes higher up in the axilla.

### 6-31 Who should have a sentinel lymph node biopsy?

Women who do not have clinical evidence of cancer spread to the axillary nodes at the time of surgery, i.e. no enlarged axillary lymph nodes.

> A sentinel lymph node biopsy is done to assess whether there has been cancer spread to the axillary lymph nodes.

### 6-32 How is the sentinel node found?

Before surgery, the breast is injected with either a radioactive substance or a blue dye. This travels along the path of the lymphatics the cancer would take if it spread to the axillary lymph nodes. At the time of surgery, these nodes can now be easily identified and removed. Sometimes they are tested for the dye or radioactivity in theatre. Sometimes they are just removed and tested later.

### 6-33 What are the advantages in doing a sentinel lymph node biopsy?

The sentinel nodes are examined by histology to assess whether they contain cancer cells. If they do not contain cancer cells then additional nodes further up the axilla do not need to be removed. The fewer the nodes removed, the fewer the postoperative complications.

Chemotherapy

### 6-34 What is chemotherapy?

Chemotherapy is the use of drugs (chemicals) to treat cancer. Chemotherapy interferes with all the stages of cancer development:

*	Rapid, uncontrolled reproduction (proliferation) of new cells
*	Loss of normal function of the cells (de-differentiation)
*	Invasion into the surround tissues
*	Spread around the body (metastases)

Chemotherapy has no means of distinguishing healthy cells from cancer cells so is associated with a lot of side effects as healthy cells are also damaged. There are many different regimes of chemotherapy and the type given depends on many factors.

### 6-35 What are the main principles behind the decision to give a particular type of chemotherapy?

The following factors need to be considered:

*	If it is given as adjuvant therapy and the intention is to cure the patient then chemotherapy with strong side effects may be given.
*	If it is given when a woman already has metastatic cancer (spread around the body) and it is clear that she cannot be cured, chemotherapy with less side effects is given to slow the spread of the cancer.
*	Most chemotherapy given as adjuvant therapy will result in the women losing her hair.
*	If a second course of chemotherapy has to be given, different drugs are generally used.
*	More than one drug is given in neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy but a single drug may be given to women for palliative care.
*	Using more than one drug may make the tumour shrink faster but gives more side effects.

### 6-36 When is chemotherapy given?

*	When the cancer has been removed but there is a high risk of recurrence (the cancer coming back in the same place): adjuvant therapy is given.
*	When there is a need to reduce the size of the cancer to allow surgical removal of the cancer: neoadjuvant therapy is given.
*	When the cancer is incurable: it may be given to prolong the woman’s life or to improve the quality of life. When it is given to improve the symptoms of the cancer, it is known as palliative chemotherapy.

### 6-37 How is the decision made to give adjuvant chemotherapy?

It should be a multidisciplinary decision. That means it should be a decision made by a group of professionals: oncologists, radiotherapists and surgeons. Once the type of cancer (including the grade and hormone sensitivity) and the stage are known the prognosis and likely response to treatment can be worked out. Based on this, a woman may be advised to have chemotherapy.

In general, a young fit patient will be advised to have adjuvant chemotherapy if any one of the following is present:

*	A grade 3 cancer
*	An ER −ve cancer
*	A HER2 +ve cancer
*	A cancer affecting more than 3 axillary lymph nodes
*	A cancer bigger than 3 cm

> The decision about what treatment a woman should have must be made by a multidisciplinary team.

### 6-38 Who is advised to have neoadjuvant chemotherapy?

*	Patients with inflammatory carcinoma.
*	Women with inoperable cancer.
*	Women who wish to have a wide local excision but cannot as their cancers are too large.

### 6-39 When is palliative chemotherapy given?

*	When cure is not possible.
*	When the aim is to prolong quality survival. That means that it is better to increase survival but the quality of the women’s life is really important.

For palliative chemotherapy a single drug may be given.

## Hormone (endocrine) treatment of breast cancer

### 6-40 Who should have hormone treatment for breast cancer?

Anyone who has a breast cancer that has estrogen (oestrogen) receptors on their cancer cells, i.e. any ER +ve cancers. If the cancer cells have receptors for estrogen, then the woman’s own estrogen can stimulate the growth of the cancer. If the estrogen can be blocked or the source removed, the cells will not survive. Hormone treatment is not effective if the cells do not have estrogen receptors, i.e. ER –ve.

> Hormone treatment is used in women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells.

### 6-41 How does hormonal treatment work?

There are 2 types of drugs used in hormone treatment:

*	Drugs that stop the action of estrogen by blocking the receptors
*	Drugs that stop all estrogen production

Both types of drug will prevent the ER +ve cancer cells from multiplying.

### 6-42 Which drug blocks the estrogen receptors?

Tamoxifen. Although tamoxifen blocks estrogen receptors on ER +ve breast cancer cells, and thereby prevents cell growth, it stimulates growth in other types of cell such as bone and endometrial cells.

> Tamoxifen blocks estrogen receptors on estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells.

### 6-43 How long do drugs that block the estrogen receptors take to work?

They take 4 to 6 weeks to start working.

### 6-44 Where does estrogen come from?

*	In premenopausal women, nearly all the estrogen comes from the ovaries.
*	Although the ovaries stop working after menopause some estrogen can still be produced using a different pathway in fat cells.

### 6-45 Which drugs prevent estrogen production by the body?

*	In premenopausal women, the ovaries can be turned off with goserelin (Zoladex)
*	In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitors can be used (anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane). These drugs stop the production of estrogen from other hormones. They are effective only if the ovaries have stopped working.

> Aromatase inhibitors stop estrogen production in postmenopausal women.

### 6-46 Which drugs should be chosen for hormone treatment?

The choice of drugs depends on whether the woman is premenopausal or postmenopausal:

*	In premenopausal women only tamoxifen and goserelin can be used.
*	In postmenopausal women, a combination of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors are given. They are never given together. This results in few side effects.

### 6-47 How long should the drugs be given?

Traditionally, they have been given for 5 years and are started after chemotherapy and radiotherapy have finished. Recently it has been shown that many women should have hormone treatment for 10 years.

### 6-48 How effective is hormone treatment?

It will decrease the risk of getting a recurrence from the breast cancer by 50% and decrease the risk of another breast cancer by 50%.

Targeted therapy

### 6-49 What is Herceptin?

Herceptin is the trade name for trastuzumab. It is an example of a drug used in targeted therapy. Herceptin binds to the HER2 receptor on the outside of some breast cancer cells and slows their growth and multiplication. It has very few side effects as very few normal cells have receptors for Herceptin.

### 6-50 Why is Herceptin not given to everyone?

*	Only some breast cancers are HER2 +ve (i.e. have the receptor that Herceptin can bind to). Herceptin does not work on HER2 –ve cancer cells.
*	It is very expensive.

## Radiotherapy

### 6-51 What is radiotherapy?

Radiotherapy is the use of high-energy rays (such as X-rays) to destroy cancer cells. It is only effective at the site where it is given. Therefore it is an example of local treatment.

Radiotherapy kills any cancer cells which have been left behind after surgery.

### 6-52 How is radiotherapy used in breast cancer?

Radiotherapy is used for both adjuvant and therapeutic treatment.

### 6-53 When is radiotherapy given for adjuvant treatment?

Adjuvant radiotherapy is given after surgery:

*	Radiotherapy is nearly always given to the breast area if a wide local excision has been done rather than a mastectomy.
*	It is given after a mastectomy if the cancer was big or had spread to a lot of lymph nodes.
*	It is sometimes used when there is only ductal carcinoma in situ.

> Radiation to the breast is nearly always needed after wide local excision.

### 6-54 What effect does adjuvant radiotherapy have?

It will reduce the chance of the cancer coming back locally on the chest wall or in the axilla and improves survival.

> Adjuvant radiotherapy reduces the risk of cancer recurring on the chest wall and axilla.

### 6-55 Who should not have adjuvant radiotherapy?

*	Women who have had previous radiotherapy (e.g. lymphoma patients)
*	Pregnant women
*	Women with a weak heart or lungs: the radiotherapy may reduce function of either so make them a little worse. If function is normal, the slight decrease will not be noticed.
*	Women with a frozen shoulder

### 6-56 How is adjuvant radiotherapy given?

*	A CT scan is taken of the area and the breast is marked with a special pen.
*	It is generally given to the armpit and to the supraclavicular nodes.
*	An extra dose is given to the site of the original breast cancer.

### 6-57 When is adjuvant radiotherapy given?

Generally it is started about 1-2 months after surgery or chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is generally given first if it is needed.

### 6-58 When is therapeutic radiotherapy given?

*	Therapeutic radiotherapy is given to treat inoperable breast cancer and to metastatic breast cancer.
*	It is very effective in treating bone pain caused by cancer.
*	It will also strengthen bone weakened by cancer and prevent it from fracturing.

## Case study 1

A young premenopausal woman with small breasts presents with a small breast cancer. She is unmarried and worried that treatment will leave her disfigured. After discussion by a multidisciplinary team she is offered a choice of local and systemic management.

### 1. What does local management mean?

Local management is the treatment given to the breast and axilla.

### 2. What local treatments are available?

Surgery (wide local excision or mastectomy) and radiotherapy if wide local excision is used.

### 3. What is systemic management?

This is treatment which is given to the whole body.

### 4. What types of systemic treatment can be used?

*	Hormone therapy (tamoxifen or goserelin in a premenopausal woman)
*	Chemotherapy
*	Targeted therapy

## Case study 2

A 45 year old mother of two children has a breast lump found on a mammogram. A diagnosis of cancer is confirmed on histology. Examination of the other breast and both axillae is normal. She chooses to have surgery and a sentinel node biopsy is found to be positive. She is offered adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery.

### 1. What is a sentinel node biopsy?

It is a biopsy taken at the time of surgery to determine whether there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes. This is the first lymph node or nodes to be reached by cancer cells spreading from the breast to the axilla.

### 2. What is an axillary clearance?

This is removal of all the axillary nodes. It is done if cancer cells have spread to these nodes.

### 3. What are the complications of axillary node clearance?

*	Numbness down the inner side of the arm
*	Lymphoedema
*	Seroma

### 4. What is adjuvant radiotherapy?

Radiotherapy to the breast and axilla after surgery to reduce the risk of local recurrence of cancer.

## Case study 3

A 55 year old postmenopausal woman presents with a 2 cm ductal carcinoma in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast. It shows up on the mammogram and there are no other masses. There are no nodes that can be seen on ultrasound scan or felt in her armpit. The cancer is ER +ve.

### 1. Would she be suitable for a wide local excision if that was her preference?

Yes, as long as there is no reason for her not to have radiotherapy.

### 2. Will she be advised to have hormone therapy?

Yes, as she has an ER +ve tumour.

### 3. Is she suitable for an aromatase inhibitor?

Yes, she could have either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor as she is postmenopausal.

### 4. How do these drugs work?

Tamoxifen blocks the action of estrogen on any remaining cancer cells while an aromatase inhibitor blocks the formation of estrogen from other hormones.

## Case study 4

An elderly woman presents with a large 6 cm breast lump which is found to be an invasive ER −ve, HER2 +ve ductal cancer. She has lymph nodes palpable in her axilla. She is advised to have neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. 

### 1. What is neoadjuvant chemotherapy?

This is chemotherapy that is given before surgery. It will reduce the size of the tumour, making surgery possible.

### 2. How does this differ from adjuvant chemotherapy?

Adjuvant chemotherapy is given after surgery with the aim of curing the patient by killing any remaining cancer cells which may remain in the body.

### 3. Will she be advised to have an aromatase inhibitor?

No. Her cancer is ER −ve so it will not work.

### 4. If it is available to her, would she be advised to have Herceptin?

Yes. Her cancer is HER2 positive.

# Side effects of breast cancer treatment

## Objectives

When you have completed this chapter, you should be able to:

*	List the side effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy and surgery.
*	Know how to manage these complications.
*	Identify patients with side effects who need urgent referral.

## Case study 1

A 60 year old woman who has had her first cycle of chemotherapy for breast cancer is seen with a fever and feeling generally unwell. She started her chemotherapy 10 days before but is unsure what drugs she is receiving. On examination, she looks pale, is vomiting and has a temperature of 39.5 °C. She also complains that she has had a sore mouth for the past few days.

1.	What is the possible diagnosis?
2.	What urgent test should be done?
3.	How should she be treated?
4.	Should she be referred to the hospital?
5.	What is the probable cause of her sore mouth?

## Case study 2

A 45 year old woman had a mastectomy for breast cancer 3 years ago and is now on tamoxifen. She wants to stop her hormone therapy as she feels tired on the treatment. She has heard that it causes thinning of the bones and cancer of the uterus.

1.	For how long should she stay on tamoxifen?
2.	What effect does tamoxifen have on the bones?
3.	How can cancer of the uterus be screened for?
4.	What other side effects can you get from tamoxifen?
5.	Why are there such a wide range of side effects of tamoxifen?

## Case study 3

A 38 year old woman comes to the clinic 1 year after a right-sided mastectomy for breast cancer. She has had a swollen right arm for a few months. The swelling became worse a few days back after she had cut her hand.

1.	What is the diagnosis?
2.	What treatment should be started immediately?
3.	What should be looked for on examination?
4.	If the swelling persists, what treatment can be given?

## Case study 4

A 60 year old woman is receiving adjuvant radiotherapy after breast surgery. She has an area of redness and sensitivity in the area being radiated and is worried that she will lose all her hair. She sleeps most of the day as she feels very tired.

1.	What local skin changes can be expected with radiotherapy?
2.	How should the acute skin changes be managed?
3.	Will she lose her hair?
4.	Is it common to feel tired during radiothearapy?

## Side effects of chemotherapy

### 7-1 What are the common drugs used for chemotherapy?

The commonest regimes to be used in South Africa for breast cancer are:

*	CAF: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), 5-fluorouracil
*	CEF: cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil
*	CMF: cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil

These regimes can be used alone or in combination with taxanes such as paclitaxel and docetaxel.

Note
:	Adriamycin is a trade name for doxorubicin.

### 7-2 What are the side effects of chemotherapy?

There are many side effects of chemotherapy. They depend on the regime being given and the individual’s response to treatment. The commonest side effects are:

*	Hair loss
*	Nail changes
*	Nausea and vomiting
*	Mucositis
*	Diarrhoea
*	Constipation
*	Neutropenic sepsis
*	Fatigue
*	‘Chemo brain’
*	Aching joints
*	Neuropathy
*	Infertility
*	Psycho-social issues

### 7-3 Which drugs lead to hair loss?

The commonest drugs that are used to treat breast cancer cause hair loss:

*	Epirubicin and doxorubicin (the ‘red devils’: they are in CEF or CAF)
*	Paclitaxel and docetaxel (the taxanes)
*	Some other drugs that are less commonly used may also cause hair loss

### 7-4 When does hair loss occur and does it regrow?

It usually starts falling out within days after the first dose. Hair loss on the head and elsewhere on the body may be complete or partial. It is very rare for hair not to grow back but it often is not as thick and may be grey or curly.

> Hair usually grows back after chemotherapy.

### 7-5 How are the nails affected and what can be done about the side effects?

Nails become ridged and discoloured. Although nail changes cannot be prevented, it is better if standard nail care is increased. It is important that all patients regularly:

*	Use moisturisers on their nails
*	Use nail clippers to keep their nails short

In addition, it is important to prevent damage by:

*	Avoiding chemicals such as washing up liquid, soap powder and household cleaners
*	Wearing gloves whenever possible

### 7-6 What drugs cause nausea and vomiting and when do these side effects occur?

Nausea and vomiting can occur with any chemotherapy drug but the following commonly cause vomiting:

*	Epirubicin and doxorubicin
*	Cisplatin and carboplatin (these are sometimes used for breast cancer)

Vomiting can occur:

*	Acutely at the time the drug is given and continues for the first 24 hours
*	After 24 hours (delayed vomiting)
*	In anticipation. The patient thinks about chemotherapy and feels nauseous.

### 7-7 Why does vomiting occur with chemotherapy?

*	The drugs may have a direct effect on the stomach and small intestine.
*	The drugs may stimulate the vomiting centre in the brain directly.
*	The smell or the thought of chemotherapy may stimulate the vomiting centre.

### 7-8 What drugs can be used to prevent vomiting and how should they be given?

Anti-emetics (anti-nausea drugs) are used to treat vomiting:

*	Direct action on the brain: drugs such as stemetil, cyclizine (Valoid) and omeprazole.
*	Stomach emptying into the small intestine can be stimulated by metoclopramide (Maxolon)
*	Benzodiazepines (e.g. Valium) can be used to reduce anticipatory vomiting: vomiting that is caused by the thought of chemotherapy
*	Newer agents such as the serotonin receptor antagonists: ondansetron and granisetron 

Anti-emetics can be given orally, rectally or intravenously.

To try and prevent vomiting, both anti-emetics and steroids are given together with the chemotherapy. For the first few days after chemotherapy, valoid suppositories and stemetil tablets should be given even if there is no nausea.

### 7-9 What non-drug treatment can be used for prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting?

*	The patient should have small frequent meals.
*	Dehydration must be avoided so adequate oral fluids should be given.
*	Intravenous fluids may have to be given if dehydration is suspected.

### 7-10 What is mucositis and what drugs cause it?

Mucositis is inflammation of the mucous membranes. Generally, it affects the gums and the intestinal lining.

It is commonly seen when cyclophosphamide, methotrexate or 5-fluorouracil are given. These drugs are in the CMF regime.

### 7-11 What symptoms are caused by mucositis?

Pain in the mouth which may lead to dehydration. As a result of the inflammation, there may be secondary infections, particularly *Candida*.

### 7-12 How can mucositis be managed?

It can be managed by good oral care:

*	Regular washing out with a mouth wash: ½ teaspoon salt plus ½ teaspoon sodium bicarbonate in 1 cup of water
*	Give regular pain killers
*	Eat a soft diet
*	Remove dentures and make sure they fit well
*	Treat any local infection, e.g. *Candida* with mycostatin (Nystatin) mouthwash

### 7-13 What drugs cause diarrhoea and when does it occur?

Methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (in CMF) are the most likely drugs to cause diarrhoea. It can occur at any stage of the treatment cycle.

### 7-14 How should diarrhoea be treated?

It must be treated as an emergency and drugs to control the diarrhoea must be given immediately. Imodium and codeine phosphate can both be used but if there is no response, the patient must be referred urgently to the oncology team.

> Refer any patient with severe diarrhoea early.

### 7-15 How should constipation be managed?

Constipation may be due to the chemotherapy drugs, analgesics (such as morphine) or anti-emetic drugs.

It is important to identify the cause of the constipation. If it is due to morphine, see the chapter on palliative care. If it is due to one of the other drugs, try changing the drug used.

### 7-16 Which side effects from chemotherapy need urgent medical attention?

*	Severe diarrhoea
*	Neutropenic sepsis

### 7-17 What is neutropenic sepsis?

*	Neutropenic means low levels of white cells in the blood (less than 2 ×10³/µL). (The correct name for low white cells is leukopenic. However, most people refer to it as neutropenic so we will use that here).
*	Sepsis means infection in the blood stream (septicaemia)

Chemotherapy drugs damage any cells that are rapidly dividing, not only cancer cells. This includes cells in the bone marrow, especially white blood cells which are needed to attack bacteria that can cause infections. Chemotherapy stops white cell production so any minor infection can become a major problem.

Note
:	More correctly a low white cell count is called leukopenia but in practice it is usually referred to a neutropenia.

### 7-18 How do you know if a woman has neutropenic sepsis?

If a patient is on chemotherapy and feels unwell, the diagnosis of neutropenic sepsis must be suspected. The patient will usually feel terrible and have a high temperature (above 38 °C) but may not have any other signs of an infection.

Ask for a full blood count (FBC) to look for a low white blood count, differential count and other signs of bone marrow suppression. The bone marrow also produces red blood cells and platelets. Therefore there may not be enough red blood cells being produced and the patient will become anaemic. A deficiency in platelets results in bruising.

Neutropenic sepsis is commonest 10 days after the first cycle of chemotherapy and is more likely to occur in older people.

Treat suspected neutropenic sepsis immediately with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics.

> A full blood count must be done urgently, a doctor called immediately and antibiotics started if neutropenic sepsis is suspected.

### 7-19 How should the other side effects be managed?

There are many non-specific side effects of chemotherapy such as tiredness, a feeling of not being able to think clearly (‘chemo brain’), aching of joints and neuropathy (pins and needles in hands and feet). These should be dealt with practically and sympathetically. They can be managed by the oncology team.

Infertility after chemotherapy is a common problem particularly in women over 35 years and should be dealt with by the oncology team. Infertility is not predictable and contraception must still be used as younger women may still be able to fall pregnant after chemotherapy.

Women receiving cancer treatment should avoid falling pregnant without discussing the risks with their oncologist.

Patients on chemotherapy often need help for psychosocial problems.

## Side effects of hormone treatment

Unlike the side effects from chemotherapy, the side effects from hormone (endocrine) treatment do not make women severely ill, so can generally be managed by the oncology team.

### 7-20 What are the common side effects of tamoxifen?

Tamoxifen was first used 40 years ago and many side effects have been listed. Most of the side effects do not occur acutely but some time after treatment has been started. The side effects of tamoxifen are due to both the estrogen blocking and estrogen-like actions of the drug. The important ones are:

*	Increased risk of blood clots, particularly deep venous thrombosis (DVT)
*	Hot flushes
*	Vaginal discharge
*	Weight gain
*	Thickening of the lining of the uterus which may lead to an increased incidence of endometrial cancer. All women on tamoxifen should have a yearly ultrasound scan of the uterus as they have a slightly higher risk of endometrial cancer
*	Decreased libido (sex drive)

Tamoxifen is taken for at least 5 years. Recently it has been advised that it be taken for 10 years.

> Tamoxifen increases the risk of deep venous thrombosis.

### 7-21 How should the side effects from tamoxifen be managed?

In general, side effects from tamoxifen should be managed by the oncological team. It is important to remember the risk of deep vein thrombosis and avoid using tamoxifen in women with a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. If a patient is going for surgery subcutaneous heparin should be considered. 

Encourage patients to decrease their calorie intake and increase their exercise to help prevent weight gain.

> Women should discuss their side effects from tamoxifen with their oncologist.

### 7-22 What are the side effects from aromatase inhibitors?

*	Muscle and joint aching
*	Osteoporosis (thinning of the bones). Of interest, tamoxifen makes the bone thicker.
*	Hot flushes
*	Dry vagina
*	Weight gain

The side effects of aromatase inhibitors are due to a lack of estrogen.

### 7-23 How should the side effects of aromatase inhibitors be managed?

The side effects should be managed by the oncology team:

*	In order to prevent osteoporosis, supplementary calcium and a bisphosphonate are generally given.
*	About 40 % of women complain of muscle and joint aching. They should be treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Brufen) or diclofenac (Voltaren).
*	Estrogen vaginal creams should not be given to women taking aromatase inhibitors.

> Estrogen vaginal creams should not be given with aromatase inhibitors.

## Side effects from radiotherapy

### 7-24 When may side effects from radiotherapy occur?

Like the side effects from hormone therapy, those from radiotherapy do not generally present acutely so can be managed by the treating team.

Side effects can occur:

*	During treatment (and for a short while afterwards)
*	After treatment

In most cases, patients having radiotherapy have daily doses so can be advised by the oncology department.

### 7-25 What side effects occur during radiotherapy treatment?

*	Skin changes
*	Hair loss in the area of irradiation
*	Lymphoedema
*	Tiredness
*	Sore throat

### 7-26 What skin changes occur in the area being irradiated?

After about 10 days of treatment, the skin becomes darker and redder. It looks like sunburn but may also be flaky. The skin may become thickened and even look similar to *peau d’orange* skin change seen with breast cancer.

There will be hair loss in the areas irradiated (e.g. under the armpit).

> Skin changes due to radiotherapy may look similar to changes due to cancer.

### 7-27 How should the skin be treated during radiotherapy?

The advice varies in different departments. Most will recommend that only simple products are used on the skin. Deodorants, perfumed soaps and talcum powder should be avoided.

If the skin is red and sore, Maizena (cornstarch) may be applied.

The skin should not be exposed to the sun.

### 7-28 What general changes occur during radiotherapy?

Many women feel tired during their radiotherapy. This tends to improve when the course of radiotherapy is completed. If the radiotherapy is to the collarbone area as well, she may develop a sore throat.

> Patients receiving radiotherapy often feel very tired.

### 7-29 What side effects occur after radiotherapy?

These are far less common than they used to be:

*	The breast may become hard and firm. If there has been a reconstruction, the reconstruction may also become hard due to fibrotic tissue.
*	As a result of improved modern radiotherapy, changes to the lungs or heart are rarely seen. If this does occur, the patient may develop a cough.
*	Occasionally, the bones in the irradiated area may be thinned.

## Side effects due to surgery

### 7-30 When may side affects occur after surgery?

These may occur:

*	Immediately (in hospital)
*	Weeks later
*	Months later

They may be due to the surgery or to the anaesthetic. Only surgery-related problems will be discussed here. All complications are commoner in smokers, diabetics, older patients and those who have had previous radiotherapy. The simpler the surgery, the less likely the complications.

### 7-31 What side effects occur immediately after surgery?

The commonest problem is bleeding. This usually occurs within 1-2 days after surgery and the women may need to return to theatre. Bleeding should be looked after by the surgical team.

### 7-32 What wound complications occur within weeks of surgery?

*	*Seroma formation*: seromas are pockets of clear or blood-stained fluid. They can occur after any breast or axillary surgery. If the seroma is small the fluid will generally be absorbed without any treatment. If the seroma becomes very hard and uncomfortable, it should be drained as a sterile procedure with a 23G needle and syringe. Seromas after a mastectomy may be very large (500-1000 ml). These should not be drained too often as they will become a chronic problem and infection may be introduced. They are more likely to be a problem if the original cancer was big or if there were a lot of lymph nodes involved.
*	*Infection*: this is uncommon in well women after a simple breast operation. Women who develop a local infection should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. If she has an infected seroma it must be drained.

Complications after a reconstruction may be difficult to deal with and must be treated by the reconstructive surgeons.

### 7-33 What shoulder complications may occur within weeks after surgery?

It is very common to have some stiffening of the shoulder even if axillary surgery has not been done. The stiffness may be very mild and will get better by itself or may be very severe.

Shoulder exercises should be done by all patients who have had axillary surgery. If the arm cannot be lifted above 90°, the women should be referred for physiotherapy. If there are no physiotherapy facilities, she must be encouraged to do regular arm exercises.

### 7-34 What long-term surgical complications can occur?

*	The most important one is lymphoedema.
*	It is common for numbness down the inside of the arm to occur after axillary surgery. This should be managed with local massage. The numbness will be permanent but it will stop bothering the woman with time.
*	Thickened bands of tissue may appear in the armpit. These can be massaged with oils, away from the wound.

## Lymphoedema

### 7-35 What is lymphoedema?

Lymphoedema is swelling of a limb caused by obstruction of the lymphatic system. As a result of obstruction to lymph drainage, lymph leaks out of the lymphatics into the surrounding tissue and causes swelling. Lymphoedema of the arm is common in patients with breast cancer. Check for cancer recurrence or new cancer in any patient presenting with lymphoedema.

### 7-36 What causes breast cancer patient to get lymphoedema?

It is caused by damage to the axillary system of lymph nodes. This may be damaged by:

*	The cancer
*	Surgery
*	Radiotherapy

Breast cancer involving the axillary nodes may block the lymphatics. The more lymph nodes that are removed at the time of surgery, the more likely it is that lymphoedema will be a problem. Lymphoedema is also more common in patients who are treated with both surgery and radiotherapy.

> Lymphoedema is more common in patients who have had both surgery and radiotherapy.

### 7-37 How can lymphoedema be prevented?

The best way to prevent lymphoedema is to diagnose cancers at an earlier stage when less surgery and radiotherapy will be needed.

Any woman who has had lymph node surgery should protect that arm. For example, she should wear gloves when gardening and not allow the arm to be used for an intravenous drip.

Sentinel lymph node surgery reduces the chance of lymphoedema as the need for axillary clearance is often reduced.

### 7-38 How can lymphoedema be managed?

An infection should be ruled out. If the arm is red and swollen, the patient should be put on antibiotics and followed up to ensure it gets better.

The simplest way to improve lymphoedema is with elevation, exercise and compression bandaging. Exercises should be done. A website listing exercises may be found at the end of the book under ‘Useful websites’.

Elevation involves keeping the arm up for as much of the day as possible.

Compression with bandaging can be very effective but must be done by a trained person.

### 7-39 Who should treat lymphoedema patients?

The best combination is a trained physiotherapist or nurse working together with the patient and her family.

### 7-40 Does lymphoedema management always work?

No. If the lymphoedema has been there for a long time, there are changes to the soft tissues in the arm which may not be reversable. As a result the arm may be permanently swollen. Only the lymphoedema fluid but not the other changes will respond to management.

> It is important to start management for lymphoedema early to try and prevent a chronic problem.

## Case study 1

A 60 year old woman who has had her first cycle of chemotherapy for breast cancer is seen with a fever and feeling generally unwell. She started her chemotherapy 10 days before but is unsure what drugs she is receiving. On examination, she looks pale, is vomiting and has a temperature of 39.5 °C. She also complains that she has had a sore mouth for the past few days.

### 1. What is the possible diagnosis?

Neutropaenic sepsis (septicaemia)

### 2. What urgent test should be done?

A full blood count. If her white blood count is below 2 × 10°/µL, it is diagnostic of neutropenic sepsis. Her pallor suggests she may also be anaemic.

### 3. How should she be treated?

*	Intravenous fluid should be started to correct any dehydration.
*	Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics must be started immediately.
*	Her vomiting should be treated with anti-emetics (Valoid, Stemetil or Maxolon) which could be given oraly, rectally or intravenously.
*	If she has her own medication from the oncology unit, that may be given.

### 4. Should she be referred to the hospital?

Yes, as an emergency. She needs to be admitted to hospital urgently as neutropaenic sepsis is a very serious condition.

### 5. What is the probable cause of her sore mouth?

Mucositis. This is a common side effect if cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil are given in the CMF regime.

## Case study 2

A 45 year old woman who had a mastectomy for breast cancer 3 years ago is now on tamoxifen. She wants to stop her hormone therapy as she feels tired on the treatment. She has heard that it causes thinning of the bones and cancer of the uterus.

### 1. For how long should she stay on tamoxifen?

Hormone therapy should be given for at least 5 years. Many women are advised to take it for 10 years.

### 2. What effect does tamoxifen have on the bones?

Tamoxifen thickens the bone. In contrast, aromatase inhibitors make the bones thinner.

### 3. How can cancer of the uterus be screened for?

The lining of the uterus will get thicker before cancer develops. Therefore the uterus should be screened with an ultrasound scan every year.

### 4. What other side effects can you get from tamoxifen?

Increased risk of blood clots particularly deep venous thrombosis (DVT), hot flushes, vaginal discharge, weight gain and decreased libido (sex drive).

### 5. Why are there such a wide range of side effects of tamoxifen?

Because tamoxifen both blocks estrogen (causing hot flushes, weight gain and decreased libido) as well as having estrogen-like effects (causing increased blood clotting, vaginal discharge and bone thickening).

## Case study 3

A 38 year old woman comes to the clinic 1 year after a right-sided mastectomy for breast cancer. She has had a swollen right arm for a few months. The swelling became worse a few days back after she had cut her hand.

### 1. What is the diagnosis?

Lymphoedema although she may have an infection making it worse.

### 2. What treatment should be started immediately?

Antibiotics.

### 3. What should be looked for on examination?

She must be examined to determine whether her cancer has not recurred.

### 4. If the swelling persists, what treatment can be given?

Exercises, elevation and compression bandaging for the lymphoedema.

## Case study 4

A 60 year old woman is receiving adjuvant radiotherapy after breast surgery. She has an area of redness and sensitivity in the area being radiated and is worried that she will lose all her hair. She sleeps most of the day as she feels very tired.

### 1. What local skin changes can be expected with radiotherapy?

After about 10 days of treatment, the skin becomes darker and redder and looks like sunburn. Less commonly the skin may become thickened and even look similar to *peau d’orange* skin change seen with breast cancer.

### 2. How should the acute skin changes be managed?

She should only use simple products on the skin. Deodorants, perfumed soaps and talcum powder should be avoided. If the skin is red and sore, cornstarch (Maizena) may be applied. The skin should not be exposed to the sun.

### 3. Will she lose her hair?

This is very unlikely as loss of hair on the head is associated with chemotherapy rather than radiotherapy. She may lose some hair in her axilla. Epirubicin, doxorubicin and the taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are the drugs usually associated with hair loss.

### 4. Is it common to feel tired during radiothearapy?

Yes. This is a very common complaint.

## Introduction to palliative care

### 8-1 What is palliative care?

Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with a life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems.

### 8-2 What is the purpose of palliative care?

The purpose of palliative care is to:

*	Improve the quality of life and relieve unpleasant symptoms rather than trying to cure the patient.
*	Provide relief from pain and other distressing symptoms.
*	Regard dying as a normal process.
*	Integrate the psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care.
*	Offer a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death.
*	Provide a support system to help the family cope during the patient’s illness and in their own bereavement.
*	Use a team approach to address the needs of patients and their families, including bereavement counselling, if indicated.

Enhancing the quality of life may also positively influence the course of illness. Palliative care does not aim to hasten or postpone death but rather to improve the quality of life.

> Palliative care aims to improve the quality of life in patients facing a life-threatening illness.

### 8-3 When should palliative care start?

Palliative care should start as soon as the diagnosis is made that this is an illness which is life-threatening and probably cannot be cured.

Note
:	Palliative care is applicable early in the course of illness, together with other therapies that are intended to prolong life, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and includes those investigations needed to better understand and manage distressing clinical complications.

> Palliative care should start as soon as the diagnosis of an incurable life-threatening illness is made.

### 8-4 What is terminal care?

Terminal or end-of-life care addresses the needs of the patient and family when you think the patient is dying. Terminal care is the last phase of palliative care and is usually given during the last weeks or days of life.

### 8-5 What is the purpose of terminal care?

This is active care with the emphasis on symptom management, comfort and dignity. The aim is not to prolong life but to help achieve a ‘good death’.

> The aim of terminal care is to provide symptom management, comfort and dignity during the dying process.

### 8-6 What is a terminal illness?

A terminal illness is an illness which cannot be cured and is expected to result in the death of the patient. However, it does not necessarily mean that the patient is expected to die in the next few weeks. Most patients with a terminal illness need palliative care until the time comes when the patient is nearing death and terminal care is needed.

Note
:	Speaking of a terminal illness is often confusing as sometimes the phrase is used to simply mean an incurable illness while at other times it means an illness which will kill the patient in the next few days or weeks.

Providing palliative care

### 8-7 How can you help a patient who needs palliative care?

The most important step is to establish a relationship with the patient and their family. It is important to develop a trusting relationship between the patient, the family and nurse/care team. 

> The first step in palliative care is winning the patient’s trust.

### 8-8 How do you gain a patient’s trust?

Remember always that you are privileged to have been invited into the patient’s space at such a vulnerable time in their lives. They are searching for a friend who is neutral, won’t take sides, and who will listen to them without judgement.

Wherever possible, take the opportunity to see the patient in their familiar surroundings. This may not be possible if you are not able to leave the clinic. If you can visit the patient at home, on entering the premises, smile warmly, tell them who you are and what you do, and, if appropriate shake their hand while looking at them and let this opportunity to touch them linger a little longer than a normal handshake. This tells them that you are not in a hurry and that you care.

### 8-9 How do you make yourself comfortable in a patient’s home?

Ask the patient if you may sit down and where they would be comfortable for you to sit. Sit close enough (as a friend would) but not so close that the patient feels threatened. Sitting behind a desk or at a table creates a barrier between you and the patient and all barriers must be avoided. Ask that the television and radio be turned off.

### 8-10 How do you start a conversation?

Try and break the ice. You can pick out a picture, e.g. a wedding photograph of a child or a certain person or group gathering and ask the patient to tell you about the picture. Or you may comment on something that you find beautiful, a plant, table cloth or piece of furniture to talk about.

### 8-11 What position should you be in?

It sometimes helps to use the letters SOLER to make sure that you are in a good position to listen to your patients:

**S**: Face your patient *Squarely*. This shows that you are interested in what they are saying and want to hear their story.

**O**: Adopt an *Open* posture. Don’t cross your arms or legs. Sit comfortably with both feet on the floor, relax your shoulder and put your hands on your knees.

**L**: *Lean* slightly toward your patient. This tells them that you are listening intently.

**E**: *Eye contact*. Make good eye contact but don’t stare.

**R**: *Relax* and be yourself.

### 8-12 Should you touch the patient or their family members?

Above the waist only! This avoids miscommunication. Touch is wonderful and comforting but you must be sensitive to the reaction of the person being touched. If they seem comfortable continue but if the patient seems uncomfortable stop.

### 8-13 How should you continue once you have broken the ice?

A useful guide is:

*	Once you feel that you have established a contact with the patient ask if they feel like talking to you. They may be feeling very tired at that stage and may just want to rest. Don’t push it! You can always come back later or ask them to visit the clinic again.
*	Allow the patient to speak and don’t interrupt. Wait for the patient to finish talking before you speak. Don’t answer for them.
*	Encourage the patient to talk by showing interest, good eye contact, nodding, smiling and asking open-ended questions. These are questions that the patient cannot answer with a yes or no. For example, instead of asking ‘were you upset when you heard the news?’ rather ask, ‘how did you feel when you heard the news?’.

### 8-14 Should you examine the patient at the first visit?

Examining the patient will give you a lot of extra information and should ideally be done at the time of the initial assessment. However, if the patient is extremely tired, nauseous, in severe pain or distressed, it might not be appropriate on the first visit. Always ask the patient if they are happy for you to examine them before doing so. This rule applies at all times. If the patient has a fungating wound, it may take a few visits before they are prepared to show you the wound. The most important priority of the first visit is to establish a trusting relationship. Once you are able to make an initial assessment, you should write a list of the problems experienced by the patient and the family and this must be updated regularly. Each problem will need to be addressed.

### 8-15 What are the important and common problems that need to be addressed with palliative care?

1.	Pain
2.	Discomfort
3.	Open wounds
4.	Bedsores
5.	Constipation
6.	Breathlessness
7.	Nausea and vomiting
8.	Mouth care
9.	Psychosocial and spiritual problems
10.	Emotional distress
11.	Incontinence (this will not be specifically covered in this chapter)

The management of pain

### 8-16 How important is pain management?

Most patients with a progressive illness such as advanced breast cancer will suffer pain at some stage. It is very important to recognise when a patient is in pain, to assess the severity of the pain and to decide on the best management of the pain. Patients often fear pain more than any other symptom.

> Good pain management is extremely important.

### 8-17 How is the severity of pain assessed?

Most patients will be able to talk about their pain and describe the site, nature and degree of pain. However, other patients may not be fully conscious and unable to complain of pain. In these patients facial expression and ‘body language’ must be used to assess pain.

### 8-18 What questions should be asked when assessing pain?

Always first check that the patient is taking their pain medication correctly and then obtain more details about the pain. The use of PQRSSTT might help:

**P**: What *provokes* (causes or precipitates) the pain?

**Q**: *Quality* (type or nature) of pain, e.g. burning, sharp, stabbing, dull ache, colicky or tingling?

**R**: Does the pain *radiate* anywhere else in the body?

**S**: *Site – where is the pain?

**S**: *Severity* – how bad is the pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain)?

**T**: *Timing* – when is the pain particularly bad?

**T**: *Treatment* – what is the patient taking and does it help?

This is important information required to decide on the correct pain management.

> It is important to obtain a clear description of the pain.

### 8-19 What is the best way of giving pain medication?

If possible pain medication should be given by mouth. It must be given *regularly* and according to a *strict schedule*, i.e. every 4 to 6 hours. It is important to prevent or reduce pain rather than only treat pain when it is already present.

> Pain medication must be given regularly using a strict schedule.

Note
:	When needed, analgesics can also be given by ‘patch’ or by continuous subcutaneous infusion.

### 8-20 What oral pain medication is usually used?

Useful pain medication (analgesics) include:

*	Paracetamol (Panado)
*	Diclofenac (Voltaren) or ibuprofen (Brufen)
*	Amitriptyline (Trepiline)
*	Morphine
*	Tramadol

### 8-21 When should paracetamol be used?

Paracetamol is a safe and effective medication for mild to moderate pain. Paracetamol is given by mouth and comes in 500 mg capsules or tablets. The dose is usually 1 g every 4 to 6 hours. A common mistake is to give too low a dose and not to give the medication frequently enough.

> Paracetamol 1 g every 4 hours is very useful in managing mild to moderate pain.

### 8-22 What anti-inflammatory medications are useful in pain management?

Diclofenac (Voltaren) and ibuprofen (Brufen) are anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) which are safe and useful in the management of mild and moderate pain.

The oral dose of Diclofenac (Voltaren) varies depending on how severe the pain is. It comes in 25 mg and 50 mg tablets. The usual dose is 25 or 50 mg given 3 times a day.

Ibuprofen (Brufen) comes in either 200 mg or 400 mg tablets. The usual dose is 200 to 400 mg given 3 times a day.

Either of these medications can be used together with paracetamol to have an added effect.

### 8-23 When can amitryptyline (Trepiline) be used in pain management?

Trepiline is used to relieve neuropathic (nerve) pain. Trepiline is a complex drug and has different effects with different doses. It acts as a pain medication by blocking pain impulses to the brain. The dose is 10 or 25 mg taken once a day. In higher doses, (75–150 mg) it can help improve sleeping. Therefore it is best to take the dose before going to sleep at night. 

### 8-24 When should morphine be used?

Morphine is extremely useful to manage severe pain, especially soft tissue pain. It must be given every 4 hours as the duration of action is short. It should be used if the patient still has pain even though they are taking 2 analgesics, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, in the correct dose at the correct frequency. Always shake the bottle of morphine to mix it well before giving a dose.

> Oral morphine should be taken every 4 hours.

### 8-25 When necessary, how should the dose of morphine be increased?

The dose of morphine is ‘titrated’ against the patient’s pain level. If morphine has been prescribed for the patient, it is important to review the patient’s response to the drug regularly. ‘Breakthrough’ pain, i.e. pain in between regular 4-hourly doses of oral morphine, indicates that the dose is too small. In the ward the dose of morphine can be increased every 4 hours while in the home this can be calculated every 24 hours and can be done telephonically.

1.	Increasing the morphine dose in the ward:
	*	If the patient still experiences pain, for example on a dose of 20 mg of morphine 4 hourly, increase the dose of morphine by 50% and review the patient’s response to the higher dose of morphine after 4 hours. Continue to increase the dose every 4 hours until the pain is controlled.
	*	Even if the patient is on a relatively high dose of morphine the dose should be increased by 50%. For example, 60 mg morphine would be increased to 90 mg.
2.	Increasing the morphine dose at home:
	*	To work out how much extra morphine the patient needs, ‘breakthrough’ doses of 50% of the regular dose may be given in between the regular doses. A strict record of how much extra morphine the patient was given during a 24 hour period must be kept. At the end of the 24 hour period the total number of milligrams that the patient received, i.e. the regular 4-hourly doses plus the extra breakthrough doses, is added together. This total is now divided by 6 to give the new regular dose every 4 hours.
	*	For example, if a patient is getting 20 mg of morphine 4-hourly then the daily total for the 6 doses will be 120 mg. If during that day and night an additional 3 doses of half of the regular amount was given, an extra 30 mg would have been given (i.e. 10 mg × 3 = 30 mg). As a result the total dose over the 24 hour period would have been 150 mg (i.e. 120 mg plus 30 mg). Therefore the regular doses needed for the next 24 hours will be 25 mg per dose (150 mg divided into 6 doses = 25 mg per dose). In this way the regular doses of morphine can be adjusted to match the patient’s need for pain medication.

> The amount of extra morphine needed in a 24-hour period can be used to calculate the correct regular dose.

### 8-26 If a patient has difficulty in swallowing, how can the drugs be given?

If the patient has problems swallowing the tablets or capsules, liquid medication can be prescribed. Morphine is frequently given in a liquid form. If the patient is unable to swallow at all, continuous subcutaneous morphine can be given with a syringe driver.

## Managing discomfort

### 8-27 Is discomfort a common problem?

Yes. Many patients needing palliative care have discomfort without necessarily having pain.

### 8-28 What can be done about discomfort?

There are many different causes of discomfort such as position, constipation or a full bladder. It is important to always ask about comfort and attempt to make patients more comfortable. Keeping patients comfortable is an essential part of good palliative care.

## Managing open wounds

### 8-29 Are open wounds common?

Unfortunately open wounds are seen in patients with advanced breast cancer, especially when patients present very late in the disease. Radiotherapy can help to reduce the size of a fungating wound and is also helpful in controlling bleeding from wounds.

### 8-30 How can a wound be assessed?

It is important not to show shock or horror at an open (fungating) wound even if there are maggots in it. The wound may be very smelly. If you can smell it, the patient will also be able to and will be ashamed.

The site and size of the wound should be noted. Ask the patient what bothers them most about the wound. Ask about bleeding, exudate and pain.

### 8-31 How can the smell from a wound be reduced?

The odour can be reduced by good hygiene, regular dressing changes and adequate disposal of soiled dressings (sealed in plastic bag, burnt or buried). Ventilation should be improved with open windows and doors. Pleasant smells (e.g. vanilla, lemon, lavender) can be introduced by burning candles or incense. A bunch of picked lavender will help. Lavender oil on the outer dressings helps.

Oral antibiotics can help control any infection that may be present in the wound, and reduce the smell. Applying antibiotic gels directly onto the wound can also help. There are also particular dressings to control an unpleasant smell such as charcoal dressing to filter odour. 

Absorbent dressings assist with leakage and discharge from wounds. Baby nappies are useful to soak up the exudate while you wait for the infection to improve and the wound to dry. Glycerin and ichthymol on gauze is helpful in wet areas of the wound when exudate is a problem. The area needs to be well covered to stop the mixture staining the linen.

Support must be given for patient and family. Always reassure the patient.

### 8-32 How can the wound be cleaned?

The wound needs to be cleaned regularly (at least once a day) to remove bacteria and dead (necrotic) tissue. Gentle irrigation (washing) with saline (salt water) is effective. Metronidazole (Flagyl) tablets can be used to make a ‘Flagyl Solution’ with which to clean the wound. Mix 2 litres of saline with 13 crushed Flagyl tablets. Crushed metronidazole (Flagyl) tablets can then be sprinkled over the wound when applying the dressing. Once the wound is clean and healing well the dressing can be left in place for two to three days. Use warm saline to soak the old dressing before removing it so as not to cause bleeding and pain when changing the dressing.

## Managing bedsores

### 8-33 What are bedsores?

Bedsores are pressure ulcers of the skin and underlying tissue. They usually occur over boney parts of the body in patients who are chronically ill and bedridden.

### 8-34 Why are bedsores important?

Bedsores (or pressure sores) are important because they are painful and can become infected causing deep wounds that are difficult to heal. They usually can and must be avoided at all times and are a result of poor nursing. Palliative care patients should not have to suffer further because of a preventable problem such as bed sores.

> Every effort must be made to prevent bedsores.

### 8-35 What are the causes of bedsores?

Bedsores are caused by pressure on one area of skin for too long. Continual external pressure for periods more than 1 to 2 hours greater reduces the blood flow to that area of the skin causing bed sores. They are more likely to form if there is dampness due to urine, faeces and sweat which makes the skin soft, cold and unhealthy and more likely to break down.

Patients who are overweight are more susceptible because of the weight on the pressure area while very thin patients may also get them because they have little tissue covering their pressure areas. All elderly patients, whose circulation is poor, are at risk.

Injury to the skin may also be caused by sharp nails or friction due to parts of the body either rubbing together or against the bed linen, e.g. restless patients.

### 8-36 How can bed sores be prevented? 

Bedbound patients must be turned at least every 2 hours. The skin must be kept clean and dry by regular washing particularly in incontinent patients.

All pressure areas must be massaged whenever their position is changed. Superficial, quick massages cause friction to the skin. Rather a deep slower massage is preferable. Damp, soft skin can be hardened with surgical spirits while dry skins can be kept supple with oils and creams.

The bedding must be kept dry, smooth, free of creases or crumbs and the patient’s heels should be kept off the bed by placing a pillow underneath the lower leg. A ‘cradle’ helps to relieve the weight and pressure of heavy blankets. A sturdy box cut at one end to fit over the legs can be used. A piece of sheepskin under the area is helpful.

Film dressings may be applied to the vulnerable area to try and prevent breakdown of the skin.

### 8-37 How are bedsores treated?

Early bed sores usually heal with careful pressure management. The most important principle of treatment is to keep the patient off the pressure point where the bedsore occurs. A bedsore cannot heal if the patient’s weight is on the sore. 

1.	Reposition the patient every 2 hours. If the patient is at home, family members must understand the importance of pressure care and arrange a roster for family members/friends/carers to reposition the patient throughout the day and the night.
2.	Support the patient’s body, arms, legs (especially heels) and head (pay attention to the ears). Special mattresses, sheep skins, and cushions are useful to support the patient.

For more severe bedsores, it is important to remove damaged/dead tissue.

If possible, clean the wound with a saline (salt water) solution. (This may be painful.) Dry the wound. Dress the wound to keep it moist, to encourage healing, prevent infection and keep the surrounding skin dry to reduce the risk of damaging it. Antibiotic ointment or gel or crushed metronidazole (Flagyl) tablets are useful if the wound is infected.

Some bedsores will require the removal of any dead tissue which can be done without anaesthetic to ensure the minimal amount of live tissue is removed.

Pain management is important particularly before and after repositioning, debridement procedures and dressing changes.

## Managing constipation

### 8-38 What is constipation?

Constipation is difficulty passing hard stools. Passing stools may also be painful or exhausting. Passing normally formed stools only every few days is not constipation.

Constipation is a very common problem in people with a long-standing illness. A careful history must be taken as patients often are shy about talking about their bowel habit. The stool should be checked for blood as passing hard stools can cause bleeding.

### 8-39 What are the common causes of constipation?

The four Fs:

*	Food intake is reduced
*	Fibre intake is reduced
*	Fluid intake is reduced
*	Fitness, mobility and strength are reduced

Another important cause is medication, especially morphine.

### 8-40 What symptoms are commonly caused by constipation?

*	The patient may have anorexia (poor appetite), nausea and vomiting with bad breath.
*	Rather than saying they have constipation, they may have overflow diarrhoea due to impacted faeces.
*	Abdominal pain is common.
*	Anal fissures, fistulas or haemorrhoids (piles) may occur.

Sometimes, there may be increased agitation due to constipation in confused patients. Constipation can cause agitiation. Anxiety, distress and embarrassment may lead to not wanting to pass stool.

### 8-41 How can constipation be managed without medication?

The patient should be encouraged to increase fluids such as water and fruit juice, as well as fresh fruit and vegetables. Honey, molasses, prunes and grated beetroot, dried fruits and marula jam are also useful. Give the patient advice about eating high-fibre foods and encourage them to add extra fibre to soups or porridge. These dietary changes can also be used to both prevent and manage constipation.

Where possible, encourage exercise. Unfortunately these measures are often not practical for palliative care patients whose appetite is poor, who may be experiencing nausea and anorexia and who may be too frail to undertake much exercise.

> It is important to prevent and treat constipation.

### 8-42 What medications can be given to manage constipation?

When using laxatives, it is important to use a stool softener such as 15 ml of sorbitol liquid or 5 ml of lactulose (Duphalac) together with a bowel stimulant such as 2 tablets of Senokot.

Whenever possible, prevent constipation. If a patient has been constipated for some time, it may be difficult to manage the initial constipation and suppositories such as glycerin and bisacodyl (Dulcolax) or an olive oil retention enema may be required. 

Morphine causes constipation and the combination stool softener and stimulant laxative should always be prescribed when using morphine unless there is concurrent diarrhoea.

## Managing breathlessness

### 8-43 Why do some ill patients get breathless?

They may have a primary physical cause such as asthma, bronchitis or emphysema. However, they may have secondaries from their cancer which can cause a pleural effusion (water on the lung), an airway obstruction (blockage) or infiltration of the lung tissue.

Chest infections, e.g. pneumonia, are more common due to the immobility of the patient.

Breathlessness may also be caused by emotional factors such as anxiety, fear, depression or anger. It is important to take a good history and decide whether there is an underlying physical cause. Breathlessness also causes anxiety and the resultant hyperventilation (breathing too fast) worsens the breathlessness. The cycle of anxiety and breathlessness can lead to a panic attack.

### 8-44 How can the physical symptoms of breathlessness be helped?

Make sure there is plenty of fresh air by opening windows. A fan may help as the sensation of a breeze on the face improves the feeling of getting enough air. Place the patient in Fowler’s or semi-Fowler’s position. Simple breathing exercises may help as may relaxation exercises. It may be necessary to adapt the patient’s activities of daily living so that there is less exertion.

Wherever possible, ensure that someone can reassure and stay with the patient while they are breathless. They can try and relax them by distracting them.

Some patients may benefit from a physiotherapist who can teach them breathing exercises which can stop them hyperventilating. Patients with a severe lung problem may need catheter oxygen. Nebulisation with saline can help for breathlessness while bronchodilators can be used if the patient is wheezing or if their ‘chest feels tight’.

### 8-45 What medication can be given to improve breathlessness?

It is important to assess the cause of breathlessness and to treat the cause such as pneumonia (with antibiotics), bronchospasm (with bronchodilators), pleural effusion (drain the effusion), cardiac failure (with diuretics).

The symptoms of shortness of breath can be treated with the following:

*	Anti-anxiety medication is important for anxiety and panic attacks. Morphine is a useful medication that reduces the sensation of shortness of breath. The dose of morphine to treat shortness of breath is lower than that needed to treat pain, 2.5 to 5 mg liquid morphine 4 hourly.
*	Steroids are useful for patients with shortness of breath from obstruction of the airway due to a tumour and for infiltration of the lung tissue.

The medication used depends on the cause of the shortness of breath.

## Nausea and vomiting

### 8-46 What are common causes of nausea and vomiting in a terminally ill patient?

*	There may be mechanical problems in the abdomen such as constipation or bowel obstruction.
*	Liver or kidney failure can make the nausea much worse.
*	Many drugs can cause nausea. Morphine commonly causes nausea and vomiting is common when morphine is first prescribed. This is a temporary side effect of morphine.
*	Fear and anxiety may make nausea worse.
*	Raised intracranial pressure due to brain secondaries may cause nausea and vomiting.
*	A raised calcium level. This is particularly common with bone secondaries.

> If a patient is stable on morphine and develops nausea, it is usually due to another cause.

### 8-47 What is the important complication of repeated vomiting?

The patient may become severely dehydrated.

### 8-48 How can nausea and vomiting be managed?

*	Stop food and liquid intake for 1 to 2 hours then gradually give frequent, small amounts of clear fluids such as water or flat Coke starting at 50 ml per hour and then increasing slowly. Make sure the patient is upright while eating or drinking.
*	Instead of water, rooibos tea, herbal tea, ginger tea or weak black Ceylon tea can be given.
*	Ensure there is a kidney dish or container close to the patient should they need to vomit.
*	If there is general nausea, the patient should not have liquids just before, during or soon after a meal. Hourly sips of water or ice chips to suck will enable the patient to drink more.
*	Avoid fatty food. Spicy food should also be avoided. Dry salty foods are best. Wherever possible, avoid cooking smells. Cold foods may not smell as much.
*	The meals should be small and frequent. They should be high in protein and kilojoules and should be offered throughout the day.
*	Mouth care is important to avoid thrush.

> Mouth care is important to prevent thrush.

Note
:	Recipes for rehydration fluid and soups are available at the end of the chapter. 

### 8-49 What medication can be used to treat nausea?

It is important to provide the patient with anti-nausea medication (anti-emetics). Oral metoclopramide (Maxolon) 5 to 10 mg every 8 hours or cyclizine (Valoid) 50 mg tablets or 100 mg suppositories every 8 hours is helpful.

Note
:	Metoclopramide (Maxolon) is useful for mechanical problems, though not in complete bowel obstruction; haloperidol (Serenace) is useful for metabolic problems such as liver or kidney failure, high calcium levels and drug side effects while cyclizine (Valoid) is useful if there is raised intracranial pressure.

## Mouth care

### 8-50 What are the problems caused by poor oral health?

A sore mouth will cause problems with eating and talking.

### 8-51 What are the causes of mouth problems in palliative care patients?

1.	Drugs: There are many oral side effects of drugs used for cancer and palliative care. They include:
	*	Dry mouth
	*	Bleeding and inflammation
	*	Necrosis of the jawbone
2.	Poor-fitting dentures
3.	Dehydration
4.	Changes due to radiotherapy
5.	Infections

### 8-52 What routine mouth care should be given?

*	Treat any mouth infection early with either:
	*	0.5% gentian violet solution
	*	Nystatin suspension: 100 000IU/ml-rinse and swallow 5 to 6 times a day
	*	2% miconazole (Daktarin) gel 2 to 3 times a day for 10 days
	*	Suck amphotericin B lozenges 10 mg 6 hourly.
*	Oral care 4 times a day: rinse out mouth and brush teeth with soft brush.
*	Remove dentures at night.
*	Use well-moistened swabs to gently clean the mouth.
*	Lips cleaned and moistened with petroleum jelly (vaseline).
*	Frequent sips of water/sucking ice cubes/acid-tasting sweets.

## Psychological and social problems

### 8-53 What are psycho-social problems?

These are emotional and community problems experienced by the patient and the whole family. The causes are many and may change during the duration of the illness.

### 8-54 What specific psycho-social problems are commonly experienced by patients needing palliative care?

*	The patient may feel the loss of independence. Many women are the centre of family life and they are used to looking after everyone else.
*	As a parent, they may feel they have lost control of their life and the ability to care for the family.
*	If they have a wound, they may feel ashamed of their body.
*	If there is a partner, the patient may feel unloved and rejected by the partner.
*	They may be scared of dying and leaving their dependents.

### 8-55 What are the financial implications of illness?

*	All illnesses are expensive and may lead to the patient not being able to work. This may result in a loss of income. Terminal illness will inevitably result in a permanent loss of income.
*	The illness itself often brings additional costs in care and medications that have to be borne by the family.

### 8-56 Should the topic of spirituality be spoken about?

It is important for healthcarers to understand what the patient’s belief system is. Gentle probing without being invasive is encouraged, simply asking if the patient has a faith or belief lets the patient know you are willing to discuss this with her. You can also ask how important their faith is and whether they belong to a faith community that is providing support at this difficult time. The patient should be offered spiritual counselling if needed and appropriate. It may be helpful to ask the family’s spiritual leader to be involved.

### 8-57 How may the issue of sexuality be discussed?

Many find it difficult to discuss sexuality but one needs to understand that sexuality does not necessarily mean sexual intercourse. Sexuality is the intimate relationship between two people and intimacy can mean just holding hands, an arm around one’s shoulder or a hug. It means ‘connecting’ with the person physically, mentally and emotionally. If a patient is not comfortable with sexual intercourse for whatever reason then there are other ways to satisfy one’s partner and these need to be discussed. A social worker can be called to counsel the couple.

### 8-58 How can a nurse help with these issues?

These are all important and difficult issues that may need counselling from a social worker. Very often a nurse who has built up trust and a good relationship with the patient can help when the patient needs to talk about their fears and problems. Often there is no time to wait for a social worker to come so this is an opportunity for the nurse to encourage the patient to speak without the nurse feeling the need to talk. The nurse does not have to come up with all or any answers. It is perfectly acceptable for the nurse to be totally honest and say that she doesn’t know. Just being there is a great comfort. Just listen and just allow the patient or family member to talk about their problems. Patients will feel better and very often through talking to a concerned listener they come up with many answers to the things that have been worrying them just by being allowed to voice their concerns. Good two-way communication is vitally important.

Therefore a nurse can play a vital and central role in providing good palliative care by:

*	Becoming the patient’s confidant
*	Taking on the role of the primary carers
*	Being the link between the patient and other members of the health team
*	Being the record keeper and reporter of patient problems
*	Being the educator of the family regarding care, diet and other needs
*	Providing both emotional and spiritual counselling

## Case study 1

A grandmother with advanced breast cancer is receiving palliative care at home. During the last week her pain has got worse and she says that the oral morphine is not helping. She also complains of nausea and constipation.

### 1. What is palliative care?

Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with a life-threatening illness rather than attempting to cure the illness. It addresses the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems. Palliative care should start as soon as a diagnosis of a fatal illness is made.

### 2. Is palliative care the same as terminal care?

No. Terminal or end-of-life care is the final stage of palliative care which is provided when the patient is dying.

### 3. How should her morphine dosage be managed?

Often morphine is not given in adequate doses and not given frequently enough. Oral morphine should be given every 4 hours as the action of morphine does not last long.

### 4. How is the correct morphine dose calculated?

The dose of morphine should be adequate to manage the pain level. If needed, ‘breakthrough’ doses of 50% of the regular 4-hourly dose may be given in between these regular doses. A strict record of how much extra morphine the patient was given during a 24 hour period must be kept. At the end of the 24 hour period the total number of milligrams that the patient received, i.e. the regular doses plus the breakthrough doses, is added together. This is now divided by 6 to give the new 4 hourly dose.

### 5. How is constipation managed?

Constipation is a common complication of morphine management:

*	The patient should be encouraged to increase the intake of fluids such as water and fruit juice.
*	Fresh fruit and vegetables are helpful. Honey, molasses, prunes and grated beetroot, dried fruits and marula jam are also useful.
*	Give the patient high-fibre foods which can be added to soups or porridge.

If these dietary changes do not solve the problem give laxatives such as Senokot 2 tablets to stimulate the colon and sorbitol 15 ml orally as a stool softener. Get the patient more mobile if possible.

## Case study 2

A 44 year old woman was diagnosed with cancer of the right breast 4 years ago. She had a lumpectomy followed by radiation but the cancer has come back and she now has an offensive, fungating wound.

### 1. How are you going to approach this woman?

It is very important that you are caring and supportive and do not show horror at the sight and smell of her wound. Be confident and reassure her that local treatment will dry out the wound and prevent the smell.

### 2. What is the management of a fungating wound that smells bad?

It is important to clean the wound. Metronidazole (Flagyl) tablets can be used to make a ‘Flagyl Solution’ with which to clean the wound. Mix 2 litres of saline with 13 crushed Flagyl tablets. ‘Flagyl Powder’ or crushed tablets can then be sprinkled over the wound when a dry dressing is applied. If Flagyl is not available, clean the wound with saline (salt water).

### 3. How can you prevent the exudate staining the bed linen?

Baby nappies are useful to soak up the exudates while you wait for the infection to improve and the wound to dry. Glycerin and ichthymol on gauze is helpful in wet areas of the wound when exudate is a problem. The area needs to be well covered to stop the mixture staining the linen.

### 4. How can you reduce the smell in the room?

Improve ventilation in the room by opening windows and doors. Introduce pleasant smells (e.g. vanilla, lemon, lavender) by burning candles or incense. Lavender oil of the outer dressings helps.

## Case study 3

A patient has breast cancer which has spread to her lungs. She is not suitable for any more chemotherapy or radiation and is referred for palliative care at a local hospice. On admission she is noted to have a large bedsore. She is weak, extremely thin and has not been able to work for the past 8 months. Her husband is not coping and seems to be staying away more. Her daughter of 16 years of age has given up school to look after her mother and cries a lot.

### 1. How can the risk of bedsores be reduced?

*	Bedbound patients must be turned at least every 2 hours and the skin must be kept clean and dry by regular washing particularly in incontinent patients.
*	All pressure areas must be given deep, slow massage whenever their position is changed.
*	Damp, soft skin can be hardened with surgical spirits while dry skin can be kept supple with oils and creams.
*	The bedding must be kept dry, smooth, free of creases or crumbs.
*	Her heels should be kept off the bed by placing a pillow underneath the lower leg. A ‘cradle’ helps to relieve the weight and pressure of heavy blankets.
*	A piece of sheepskin should be placed under the bony areas.

### 2. How should her bedsore be treated?

*	Keep the patient off the pressure point where the bedsore occurs. A bedsore cannot heal if the patient’s weight is on the sore.
*	Keep the bedsore clean.
*	Some bedsores will require the removal of any dead tissue which can be done without anaesthetic to ensure the minimal amount of live tissue is removed.

### 3. What are you going to do about her husband?

The family of patients requiring palliative care have many stresses and problems and also need help and support. There are probably financial problems as she has not worked for many months. A social worker or experienced nurse should discuss the whole situation with him and help him face and manage the many social and emotional difficulties.

### 4. What can be done about her daughter who has dropped out of school?

The daughter is not coping with the emotional and social problems of a mother who is slowly dying. She is probably depressed and also needs counselling and help. It is very important that the family is not forgotten when managing a woman with advanced breast cancer.

# Epilogue

This book has taken the subject of breast cancer and broken it down into to little fragments of information. At the centre of all this is a person with their ideals, spiritual beliefs, opinions and fears. They are part of a family and community. Their care has to take that into account.

The needs of male patients are similar and different to those of women. As most patients with breast problems are women, the chapter will continue to refer to female patients.

*Everyone has to be treated holistically.*

## What does holism mean?

Holism means that any woman should be treated as a complete person. She should not be treated as a disease or as an organ. It means treating the person with the illness not the illness in the person, thus treating body mind and spirit .

*Women are often the middle of a family. The family is part of a community.*

In order to help any patient, you must know what support she has, who she is supporting and how she feels about her problems. Ask her about her spiritual beliefs. As a health practitioner, you must listen to her concerns in order to be able to help her deal with her fears. 

*A woman may be scared even if she doesn’t have cancer. Often this is because of the stigma that is attached to the word cancer and we need to be aware of all these beliefs that impact women with cancer.*

## Alternative healers

Many women will have seen an alternative practitioner or started treating themselves. Encourage her to tell you who she has seen and what advice she was given. Find out if she is taking any other treatment. 

This book has concentrated on a conventional medical approach to the management of breast problems and so does not go into the many treatments and supplements used for the prevention and management of breast diseases. 

> Many medications and supplements can interfere with cancer drugs.

## Community groups and networking

Breast cancer is a highly politicised disease. There are thousands of organisations involved with breast cancer issues throughout the world. What is important is to know which ones are in your area and which ones are relevant to your patient’s needs.

Organisations involved with cancer issues tend to concentrate on different areas:

1.	Education/awareness
2.	Support
3.	Advocacy

## Education

Campaigns may be aimed at patients, relatives, healthcare workers or the general public. Before starting on an education programme, decide who is to be educated and what you feel they should understand. It is generally better to try and get a few clear points across rather than to try everything.

If possible, educate people in their own language using local resources. Little bits of information are often better than long essays. Use breast cancer survivors for the campaigns.

## Support

All people need support. When the diagnosis of cancer has been made, it is very important to make sure that good support structures are in place. There are many ways to get the support. 

*	Heath care workers: Social workers, counsellors, GPs, psychologists or psychiatrists may be used if they are available. In some centres, all patients are referred to one or the other. In other centres, they may not be available or affordable. 
*	Many breast cancer non-profit organisations offer support for women with breast cancer. Some organisations are run by survivors, while others are run by trained volunteers. The most important fact is that they are available in your area.
*	A buddy system can be an affordable way of getting support. Make a list of women in the clinic who have had breast cancer. Many of them will be happy to talk to a woman who is going through her treatment. A smiling face of survivor can do a lot more good than a long consultation with a healthcare worker! Wherever possible, try to find someone of a similar age who has had similar treatment.

It is our duty to offer any support we can but we have to understand that some women do not want to see another healthcare worker. 

Most people are part of a community: religious organisations, schools or sports groups. Breast cancer is so common that there is often someone within the group who has had breast cancer. They may become an informal support for the woman.

## Advocacy

Advocacy means campaigning for a cause. It may mean using political channels. A more sensible definition should include identifying a problem and fighting to get the problem solved.

There have been many examples of how breast cancer care has been improved by women fighting for their cause. It is important to spend energy and money on making a real change for the women in the community. The health issues faced by women in the developed world are very different from those in the developing world.

Recipes and diets

Home-made oral rehydration fluid to manage diarrhoea

Take 1 litre clean, safe water.

Add 8 level teaspoons sugar.

Add 1½ level teaspoons salt.

Mix well and leave covered in a cool place. Make a fresh solution every day.

*or*

Take 1 litre clean water.

Add 5 teaspoons sugar.

Add ½ teaspoon salt.

Add some fresh orange juice to taste.

Take 1 or 2 cups of either mixture after every diarrhoea stool.

Carrot soup for patients with diarrhoea

Requires carrots, salt, ground cinnamon, water.

Chop the carrots finely.

Steam until soft.

Mash carrots and add water to make a soup.

Add a pinch of salt and ground cinnamon to taste.

The BRATT diet

Bananas, rice, apple juice or sauce, toast and tea (herbal). May help to control diarrhoea.

The ABC diet

Apple, banana and carrot. Also good for diarrhoea.

Sour water for digestive problems

Sour water is very good for all digestive problems as it contains friendly flora, enzymes, vitamins and minerals. It helps for oral thrush, diarrhoea, weight gain and ulcers. Any grain (millet, sorghum, rice or barley) can be used.

Wash the millet (or another grain).

Soak 1 cup of millet in 3 cups of water (preferably water that has been boiled and cooled).

Cover tightly and leave for 2 or 3 days. The sour water is ready to drink when it starts to form bubbles. The warmer the weather the sooner it will be ready.

Strain the water from the millet.

Store in a cool place or the fridge.

Drink ½ cup 3 times per day for all digestive problems.

Sour water has a strong smell. For better taste and smell mix it with lemon, fruit juice or spice tea. Do not heat the sour water as this will destroy all the nutrients.

Make a second batch from the same grain as that used for the first batch. After straining off the water for the first batch, add some more cooled boiled water to the left-over grain, cover and leave to soak for one day. A third batch can be made in the same way from the same grain used to make the second batch. After the third batch throw away the used grain away and start again with fresh grain.
