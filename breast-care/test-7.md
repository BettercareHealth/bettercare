	-	Scarring with keloid formation
	-	Recurrence of cancer in the wound
18.	Stiffness of the shoulder after surgery:
	-	Is only seen after axillary clearance of lymph nodes
	-	Is uncommon and is usually treated with rest and pain killers
	+	Usually responds well to regular arm exercises
	-	Responds well to a course of steroids
19.	Lymphoedema is best prevented by:
	+	Diagnosing cancer early so that less surgery is needed

	-	Keeping the arm bandaged after surgery
	-	Removing all the axillary lymph nodes
20.	The management of lymphoedema includes:
