	*	Bone pain
	*	Sweating
17.	Which wound complication occurs a few weeks after surgery?
	*	Lymphoedema
	*	Seroma formation
	*	Scarring with keloid formation
	*	Recurrence of cancer in the wound
18.	Stiffness of the shoulder after surgery:
	*	Is only seen after axillary clearance of lymph nodes
	*	Is uncommon and is usually treated with rest and pain killers
	*	Usually responds well to regular arm exercises
	*	Responds well to a course of steroids
19.	Lymphoedema is best prevented by:
	*	Diagnosing cancer early so that less surgery is needed
	*	Using adjuvant radiotherapy rather than chemotherapy
	*	Keeping the arm bandaged after surgery
	*	Removing all the axillary lymph nodes
20.	The management of lymphoedema includes:
	*	A short course of antibiotics
	*	A long course of oral steroids
	*	Elevating, exercising and compression bandaging the arm
