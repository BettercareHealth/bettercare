‘Infrequently an educational document sees the light that is simply mind-blowing in both concept and detail. Such is the virtuoso manual on breast healthcare by Dr Jenny Edge and Prof David Woods. Not only does this comprehensive manual fill an educational hiatus in breast healthcare locally; their work also speaks of extraordinary passion and dedication.

'Although written specifically for nurses, it is equally suitable for community service officers and medical officers alike. The level of writing is appropriate for the target audience, and many beautiful illustrations and images complement the excellent scientific text.

'Dr Edge is to be commended for her initiative and considerable efforts. I can only describe her outstanding debut as a tour de force. It should be part of the literary arsenal of every breast surgeon and deserves a place of honour in every Breast Clinic.’– *Dr Ines Buccimaza, Breast surgeon, Durban, KwaZulu-Natal*

‘This is a well-written manual providing crucial information on the leading cancer for women in South Africa. An essential companion for health professionals in primary care.’ – *Prof J Volmink, Dean Health Services, University of Stellenbosch*

‘An easy and fascinating read’ – *Sr Riatha van As*

‘Thorough and informative’ – *Prof Eugenio Panieri*

‘Empowers nurses and offers a practical approach’ – *Dr Herbert Cubash*
