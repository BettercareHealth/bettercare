# Test 3: Special investigations of the breast

1.	The aim of special investigations of the breast is:
	-	To use surgery to make a diagnosis
	-	To use a mammogram alone to make a diagnosis
	-	To use a mammogram and ultrasound scan together to make a diagnosis
	+	To make a diagnosis without having to do surgery
2.	What is the triple test to investigate for breast cancer?
	-	Clinically examine the breast, axilla and abdomen
	+	Clinical assessment, imaging and cytology
	-	Mammogram, ultrasound scan and biopsy
	-	Chest X-ray, mammogram and needle aspiration
3.	When can an accurate diagnosis be made with the triple test?
	+	When all three tests are in agreement
	-	When two of the three tests are abnormal
	-	When any one test is abnormal
	-	An accurate diagnosis cannot be made with the triple test
4.	A mammogram makes use of:
	-	Ultrasound
	+	X-rays
	-	Large magnets
	-	Radio waves
5.	Population screening is aimed at:
	-	Everyone in the population
	+	Only a certain section of the population who may develop the problem being screened for
	-	Only people in the population at high risk for that problem
	-	Only for people who have early clinical signs of that problem
6.	Population mammogram screening for breast cancer:
	-	Is available for most women in South Africa
	-	Is available for all women over the age of 50 years
	-	Is available for all women in some provinces only
	+	Is not available to women who cannot afford private medical care
7.	Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should have regular mammograms starting:
	-	From puberty
	-	25 years of age
	+	At the age of 40 years or 10 years before the earliest age when a family member presented with breast cancer, whichever came first
	-	At the age of 50 years or when they reach menopause, whichever comes first
8.	A woman with any breast complaint should have a mammogram if she is over the age of:
	-	15 years
	-	25 years
	+	40 years
	-	70 years
9.	Which important abnormality on a mammogram suggests cancer?
	-	Dense breasts
	+	Microcalcifications
	-	Multiple small cysts
	-	Fatty breasts
10.	Is a mammogram painful?
	+	It may be uncomfortable but should not be painful
	-	It is only painful in older women who have soft breasts
	-	It is not painful unless a woman is bruised
	-	It is painful. That is why mammograms are not repeated every year
11.	Does a mammogram commonly cause cancer?
	-	Yes
	-	Only if they are repeated every year
	-	Only if there is a strong family history of cancer
	+	No
12.	What should be done if a mammogram shows a mass?
	-	It is essential that an ultrasound scan is done
	-	In private practice an MRI scan should be done
	-	The mammogram should be repeated in 3 months to assess whether the mass has increased in size or not
	+	The mass must be investigated
13.	How reliable is a mammogram in detecting cancer?
	-	All cancers will be detected
	+	15% of cancers will not show up on a mammogram
	-	25% of cancers will not show up on a mammogram
	-	A mammogram is not reliable, especially in older women
14.	An ultrasound scan is particularly useful in:
	+	Younger women
	-	Women with small breasts
	-	Women with fatty breasts
	-	Older women
15.	Which method is very useful at determining whether a lump is a cyst or a solid mass?
	-	Clinical examination
	-	A mammogram
	+	An ultrasound scan
	-	An MRI scan
16.	What is cytology?
	-	A combination of a mammogram and ultrasound scan
	+	An examination of cells obtained by fine needle biopsy
	-	An examination of tissue obtained by core biopsy needle
	-	A method of assessing whether cells from a cancer have hormone receptors
17.	What is an advantage of cytology?
	-	It does not give false positive or false negative results
	-	It is accurate in diagnosing ductal carcinoma in situ
	-	It is safe and cannot cause a pneumothorax
	+	It is simple and the results can be obtained the same day
18.	Fine needle aspiration:
	-	Requires a general anaesthetic in an operating theatre
	-	Requires a local anaesthetic
	-	Is not commonly used as it is technically difficult
	+	Is a very helpful way to investigate a breast lump
19.	What is a core biopsy (Tru-cut) needle?
	+	A special device to obtain a small sample of tissue
	-	A needle for performing fine needle aspiration
	-	A cutting needle used in an open excision
	-	A special needle to mark the lump in a stereotactic biopsy
20.	What are the advantages of an excision biopsy?
	-	It does not require local or general anaesthesia
	-	It is cheap
	+	It gives a definite diagnosis
	-	It does not cause a cosmetic abnormality
