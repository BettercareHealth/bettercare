# Test 5: Cancer of the breast

1.	Where does breast cancer usually start?
	-	In the lobes
	+	In the ducts
	-	In the connective tissue
	-	In the fat
2.	Carcinoma in situ means:
	+	The cancer cells are not invasive yet
	-	The cancer has not spread out of the breast
	-	The cancer has not spread to the other breast
	-	The cancer has not spread beyond the lymph nodes
3.	Which breast condition is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer?
	-	Breast abscess
	-	Pregnancy
	+	Atypical ductal hyperplasia
	-	Breast trauma
4.	How often is the cause of breast cancer unknown?
	-	Less than 10% 
	-	30%
	-	60%
	+	90%
5.	How is breast cancer spread?
	-	Directly through the chest wall
	-	Only via the lymphatics
	-	Only via the blood stream
	+	By both the lymphatics and blood stream
6.	What factor determines whether a breast cancer is likely to spread or not?
	-	The size of the cells
	-	The shape of the cells
	+	The stickiness of the cells
	-	The age of the cells
7.	Do all breast cancers behave in the same way?
	-	Yes, as they all grow fast
	-	Only in young women when they all grow slowly
	-	Only in postmenopausal women when they all grow fast
	+	No, as some breast cancers grow fast and others slowly
8.	What does prognosis mean?
	-	The age when the cancer presents
	+	The probable outcome of the disease
	-	When successful treatment can be stopped
	-	The time when treatment starts
9.	The grade of a breast cancer indicates:
	+	The risk of it spreading
	-	The size of the tumour
	-	The type of tumour
	-	Whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or not
10.	What does the stage of the breast cancer mean:
	-	Whether one or both breasts are involved
	-	Where in the breast the cancer is found
	+	How far it has spread
	-	The type of cells seen on cytology
11.	Estrogen receptors on breast cancer cells:
	-	Are only found in women and not men
	+	Suggest that the cancer will not spread rapidly
	-	Suggest that the cancer is very aggressive
	-	Indicates that the cancer has spread from another part of the body
12.	The commonest type of breast cancer is:
	-	Inflammatory
	-	Tubular
	+	Ductal
	-	Papillary
13.	Lobular cancer is:
	+	Usually low grade
	-	Usually widely spread at the time of diagnosis
	-	Easy to diagnose
	-	Rare
14.	Breast cancer usually presents with:
	-	A painful breast lump
	+	A breast lump that is not painful
	-	A large, swollen breast
	-	A milky discharge from the nipple
15.	What is an important clinical sign of breast cancer?
	-	Bruising of the breast
	-	Pus from the nipple
	+	*Peau dâ€™orange* skin change
	-	Breast tenderness
16.	What does a breast cancer look like on a mammogram?
	-	A black area
	-	Many small grey patches
	-	Usually a large red area with both black and white patches
	+	A white area
17.	When is a mammogram not reliable in diagnosing breast cancer?
	-	In older women with fatty breasts
	+	In young women with dense breasts
	-	In women who have had a breast reduction
	-	It is always very reliable
18.	What does a breast cancer look like on ultrasound?
	+	A black area
	-	A white area
	-	A grey area in women of childbearing age
	-	Ultrasound is of little value in diagnosing breast cancer
19.	To which organ does breast cancer usually spread?
	-	The bone marrow
	-	Lymph nodes in the abdomen
	+	Lungs
	-	Spleen
20.	Which investigation should be done in most women with breast cancer?
	-	An X-ray of the long bones in the limbs
	-	A MRI scan of the other breast
	-	A CT scan of the brain
	+	An ultrasound of the liver
