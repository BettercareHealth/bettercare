title: Infection Prevention and Control. Test 9. Antimicrobial stewardship


Antimicrobial resistance is:
-	The ability of pathogens to multiply under difficult circumstances
-	The ability of pathogens to multiply in healthcare environments
+	The ability of pathogens to grow in the presence of a drug that would normally kill them
-	The ability of pathogens to overcome the human host’s immune defences.

Antimicrobial resistance: 
-	Results in better outcomes for patients
-	Has decreased costs of treatment for common infections
-	Is not a common problem worldwide 
+	Makes available antimicrobials less effective and infections more difficult to treat. 

The development of antimicrobial resistance is:
-	An entirely preventable phenomenon
+	An inevitable phenomenon as pathogens evolve and adapt to new environments
-	Unaffected by antimicrobial usage
-	Not a problem as new antimicrobials are being developed constantly. 

Antimicrobial resistance in healthcare facilities is spread mainly by: 
+	Poor IPC practices (including poor hand hygiene compliance)
-	Use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal farming
-	Inadequate environmental cleaning
-	Exposure of pathogens to disinfectants.

Patients with antimicrobial resistant infections:
-	Are less likely to die from their infection than patients with drug-sensitive pathogens
+	Are more likely to die from their infection than patients with drug-sensitive pathogens
-	Have shorter duration of hospitalisation than patients with drug-sensitive pathogens 
-	Cost less to treat than patients with drug-sensitive pathogens.

Antimicrobial stewardship programmes:
-	Aim to improve patient outcomes
-	Raise awareness of the problem of antimicrobial resistance
-	Encourage rational usage of antimicrobials
+	All of the above. 

The most important reason to implement antimicrobial stewardship is: 
+	To conserve the effectiveness of antimicrobials for the future
-	To save healthcare facilities money
-	To limit the number of antimicrobials that doctors can prescribe
-	To avoid patients developing side-effects from antimicrobials.

The negative consequences of antibiotic overuse and misuse are called: 
-	Consequent damage
+	Collateral damage
-	Concomitant damage
-	Consequential damage.

The ideal antimicrobial stewardship committee should be made up of: 
-	Clinicians (doctors and nurse practitioners) and data managers
-	Hospital management, a microbiologist and a senior doctor
-	Pharmacy, the IPC practitioner and a senior doctor
+	A manager, clinician, pharmacist, microbiologist, data manager and IPC practitioner. 

Information on antimicrobial usage can be used by the stewardship committee to:
+	Identify high usage drugs and clinical areas that use them most
-	Punish individual ‘high-volume’ prescribers  
-	Impose penalties on the clinical areas with highest usage
-	Draw up local guidelines for antimicrobial usage.

Essential resources needed for an antimicrobial stewardship programme include:
-	Significant funding or financial resources from the healthcare facility
-	An infectious diseases physician
-	A pharmacist with training in infectious diseases
+	An enthusiastic and dedicated antimicrobial stewardship programme committee. 

Antimicrobial stewardship programmes can save healthcare facilities money by: 
-	Saving patients’ lives 
+	Reducing length of hospitalisation and avoiding unnecessary drug usage
-	Preventing spread of drug-resistant pathogen
-	Preventing colonisation of staff members with resistant pathogens.

The IPC practitioner contributes to antimicrobial stewardship through: 
+	Multiple activities that reduce the spread of resistant pathogens
-	Reporting poor IPC practices to the healthcare facility manager 
-	Performing daily ward rounds in the clinical areas  
-	Advising clinicians on incorrect prescribing practices.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy: 
-	Is given routinely before appropriate microbiological specimens have been taken
-	Consists usually of a single antimicrobial drug that targets the most likely pathogen
+	Usually includes several anti-infective drugs that cover  the most likely causative pathogens
-	Is continued even after the definitive cause of the infection is identified. 

Targeted antimicrobial therapy:
+	Aims to match the antimicrobial given to the specific pathogen-causing infection
-	Uses broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover all potential pathogens 
-	Does not require the collection of appropriate microbiological specimens
-	Usually requires several different antimicrobials to be prescribed.

Selective reporting: 
-	Involves microbiologists phoning clinicians to inform them of drug-resistant pathogens 
-	Presents clinicians with all possible antimicrobial treatment options for confirmed pathogens
-	Discourages prescribers from using targeted antimicrobial therapy
+	Presents clinicians with only the most narrow-spectrum antimicrobials that the pathogen is sensitive to. 

De-escalation of antimicrobial therapy:
-	Means changing the patient’s prescription from a narrow to a broad-spectrum antimicrobial
-	Is potentially harmful, even if the pathogen is sensitive to a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial 
+	Ensures effective therapy but reduces harmful effects of broad-spectrum antimicrobials  
-	Means that therapy should be stopped or discontinued.  

Prolonged courses of antimicrobials: 
+	May encourage the development of antimicrobial resistance
-	Do not increase the risk of side-effects for patients
-	Are needed as prophylaxis for patients undergoing surgical procedures 
-	Are needed for all patients with serious infections.

An antimicrobial restriction policy:
-	Prevents clinicians from accessing essential antimicrobials
+	Limits access to selected antimicrobials, without prior approval from a senior person 
-	Should be implemented identically at all healthcare facilities 
-	Does not need clinicians with insight into antimicrobial management to be available.

Antimicrobial prescription guidelines: 
-	Should be based on international antimicrobial recommendations 
-	Are unhelpful when implementing antimicrobial stewardship
+	Give recommendations on antimicrobial selection, dose and duration based on local data 
-	Give recommendations on which brands of antimicrobials to use.
