title: Breast Care. Test 3. Special investigations of the breast


The aim of special investigations of the breast is:
-	To use surgery to make a diagnosis
-	To use a mammogram alone to make a diagnosis
-	To use a mammogram and ultrasound scan together to make a diagnosis
+	To make a diagnosis without having to do surgery

What is the triple test to investigate for breast cancer?
-	Clinically examine the breast, axilla and abdomen
+	Clinical assessment, imaging and cytology
-	Mammogram, ultrasound scan and biopsy
-	Chest X-ray, mammogram and needle aspiration

When can an accurate diagnosis be made with the triple test?
+	When all three tests are in agreement
-	When two of the three tests are abnormal
-	When any one test is abnormal
-	An accurate diagnosis cannot be made with the triple test

A mammogram makes use of:
-	Ultrasound
+	X-rays
-	Large magnets
-	Radio waves

Population screening is aimed at:
-	Everyone in the population
+	Only a certain section of the population who may develop the problem being screened for
-	Only people in the population at high risk for that problem
-	Only for people who have early clinical signs of that problem

Population mammogram screening for breast cancer:
-	Is available for most women in South Africa
-	Is available for all women over the age of 50 years
-	Is available for all women in some provinces only
+	Is not available to women who cannot afford private medical care

Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should have regular mammograms starting:
-	From puberty
-	25 years of age
+	At the age of 40 years or 10 years before the earliest age when a family member presented with breast cancer, whichever came first
-	At the age of 50 years or when they reach menopause, whichever comes first

A woman with any breast complaint should have a mammogram if she is over the age of:
-	15 years
-	25 years
+	40 years
-	70 years

Which important abnormality on a mammogram suggests cancer?
-	Dense breasts
+	Microcalcifications
-	Multiple small cysts
-	Fatty breasts

Is a mammogram painful?
+	It may be uncomfortable but should not be painful
-	It is only painful in older women who have soft breasts
-	It is not painful unless a woman is bruised
-	It is painful. That is why mammograms are not repeated every year

Does a mammogram commonly cause cancer?
-	Yes
-	Only if they are repeated every year
-	Only if there is a strong family history of cancer
+	No

What should be done if a mammogram shows a mass?
-	It is essential that an ultrasound scan is done
-	In private practice an MRI scan should be done
-	The mammogram should be repeated in 3 months to assess whether the mass has increased in size or not
+	The mass must be investigated

How reliable is a mammogram in detecting cancer?
-	All cancers will be detected
+	15% of cancers will not show up on a mammogram
-	25% of cancers will not show up on a mammogram
-	A mammogram is not reliable, especially in older women

An ultrasound scan is particularly useful in:
+	Younger women
-	Women with small breasts
-	Women with fatty breasts
-	Older women

Which method is very useful at determining whether a lump is a cyst or a solid mass?
-	Clinical examination
-	A mammogram
+	An ultrasound scan
-	An MRI scan

What is cytology?
-	A combination of a mammogram and ultrasound scan
+	An examination of cells obtained by fine needle biopsy
-	An examination of tissue obtained by core biopsy needle
-	A method of assessing whether cells from a cancer have hormone receptors

What is an advantage of cytology?
-	It does not give false positive or false negative results
-	It is accurate in diagnosing ductal carcinoma in situ
-	It is safe and cannot cause a pneumothorax
+	It is simple and the results can be obtained the same day

Fine needle aspiration:
-	Requires a general anaesthetic in an operating theatre
-	Requires a local anaesthetic
-	Is not commonly used as it is technically difficult
+	Is a very helpful way to investigate a breast lump

What is a core biopsy (Tru-cut) needle?
+	A special device to obtain a small sample of tissue
-	A needle for performing fine needle aspiration
-	A cutting needle used in an open excision
-	A special needle to mark the lump in a stereotactic biopsy

What are the advantages of an excision biopsy?
-	It does not require local or general anaesthesia
-	It is cheap
+	It gives a definite diagnosis
-	It does not cause a cosmetic abnormality
