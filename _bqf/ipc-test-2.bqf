title: Infection Prevention and Control. Test 2. Micro-organisms of relevance to infection prevention and control


Micro-organisms are:
-	Visible to the naked eye
-	All harmful to human health
-	Only found on humans and family
+	Very small, single or multi-celled life forms.

Pathogens are: 
+	Micro-organisms that can cause disease in humans
-	Not able to overcome the body’s immune defences
-	Not transferrable from one person to another 
-	Not harmful to human health. 

Bacteria are easily recognisable under the microscope because they: 
-	Move about slowly
-	Stain yellow or green with Gram stain
-	Form into long string-like filaments
+	Follow particular grouping or clustering patterns.

The most common method used to stain bacteria for identification under the microscope is: 
-	The Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain
-	The methylene blue stain
+	The Gram stain
-	The carbol fuchsin stain.

The Gram stain can assist with bacterial identification by: 
-	Identifying the growth requirements of the bacteria
+	Differentiating Gram-positive from Gram-negative organisms by colour
-	Identifying which bacteria are antibiotic-resistant
-	Identifying whether bacteria are pathogens or not.

Regarding growth of bacteria:
+	Bacteria need the right nutrients, humidity and temperature to multiply
-	Bacteria can replicate as fast as every two minutes
-	Bacteria can only grow if oxygen is available
-	The phase of rapid bacterial growth is called the ‘lag phase’. 

Regarding viruses:
-	Most viruses infect cells of the endocrine system
-	Viruses with an envelope are more difficult to kill
+	Viruses can only survive inside of the host’s cells (intracellularly)
-	Most viruses are not easily transmissible.

What is the main route of infection transmission in healthcare facilities? 
-	Respiratory transmission
+	Contact transmission
-	Inoculation
-	Ingestion.

Which of the following are required for an infection to be transmitted?
-	A host with a good immune system
-	The bacteria must be Gram positive
-	The bacteria must be Gram negative
+	An infectious agent or pathogen.

What is the chain of infection?
+	The sequence in which an infection is transmitted from its reservoir to its host
-	The list of people who have been linked to an outbreak of infectious disease 
-	The route by which a particular infection is spread 
-	A theory about how infectious disease outbreaks are started.

With regard to colonisation:
-	The host’s normal flora provide no protection against colonisation 
+	Colonising micro-organisms can be potentially transmitted to others
-	Colonisation always results in development of infection
-	Carriage of colonising micro-organisms is lifelong.

Micro-organisms cause disease in the host by: 
-	Causing local inflammation 
-	Using up nutrients needed by the normal flora
+	Using their virulence factors to overcome the host’s defences
-	Multiplying until their growth is out of control.

With regard to host invasion by micro-organisms:
-	Endogenous micro-organisms cannot invade the host and cause infection
-	Colonising micro-organisms cannot invade the host and cause infection 
-	The host has no way to prevent infection after microbial invasion has occurred 
+	A weakened immune system puts the host at higher risk of microbial invasion.

Normal flora:	
+	Are micro-organisms that live in and on the human body without causing infection
-	Only live on the body for short periods of time (hours)
-	Are not affected by antibiotic use in the host
-	Cannot be transferred from person-to-person by close contact. 

Factors that increase the likelihood of healthcare-associated infection are:
-	Many empty hospital beds
-	A very tight control of antibiotic use
-	Handrubs rather than hand sprays
+	The presence of indwelling devices, e.g. drips, urinary catheters.

Healthcare-associated infections: 
-	Occur less than 48 hours after admission to hospital
+	Include site-specific and device-associated infections
-	Do not include gastrointestinal tract infections that develop in hospital
-	Do not include respiratory tract infections that develop in hospital.

Standard precautions:  
-	Reduce the chance of infection transmission from known sources of infection only
-	Are the specific precautions taken to prevent droplet transmission of infection 
+	Should be applied to all patients, by all healthcare workers, at all times  
-	Should only be applied when there is an obvious infection risk, e.g. a blood spill. 

The laboratory has an important role to play in infection control by: 	
-	Informing IPC and healthcare staff of patients with transmissible pathogens
-	Assisting clinicians with rational selection of antibiotics/antibiotic stewardship
-	Assisting IPC practitioners with outbreak investigation 
+	All of the above.

Meaningful microbiology laboratory results can be obtained when: 	
-	The sample is kept on ice while in transit.
+	Appropriate aseptic technique is used during specimen collection
-	The specimen is delayed in transit to the laboratory
-	The attending doctor asks a student to obtain the specimen.

When interpreting microbiology culture results: 
-	All cultured pathogens should be treated with appropriate antibiotics 
-	The possibility of culture contamination is very small
+	The pathogen cultured should be interpreted in the context of the patient’s clinical picture 
-	The possibility of colonisation rather than infection is not worth considering.
