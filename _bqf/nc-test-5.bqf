title: Newborn Care. Test 5. Care of high-risk and sick infants


Classifying an infant as high risk indicates that:
-	The infant is sick.
-	The infant will probably die.
+	The infant has a greater chance of developing a problem than most infants.
-	The infant must be treated urgently.

Which event suggests that an infant should be classified as high risk?
-	Term delivery
+	Low birth weight
-	An Apgar score of 8 at 1 minute
-	A birth weight that is appropriate for the gestational age

What is the first step in the management of a high-risk infant?
-	Treat the clinical problem as early as possible.
-	Monitor the vital signs.
+	Identify the expected problem.
-	Take steps to prevent the problem.

Why is it important to monitor a high-risk infant?
-	To obtain hospital records
-	To reassure the parents
+	To detect problems
-	To treat the infant

Which of the following signs indicates that the infant is sick?
-	Preterm delivery
-	Birth weight of 1500 g
-	Delivery by Caesarean section
+	Apnoea

Which of the following is called a vital sign?
-	Birth weight
-	Jaundice
+	Heart rate
-	Oedema

A sick infant should be handled as little as possible because:
+	Excessive handling may cause apnoea.
-	Handling slows an infant’s weight gain.
-	Handling may cause bruising.
-	Handling increases the risk of bacterial infection.

Sick infants should be weighed every day because:
+	Weight loss may indicate dehydration.
-	Weight loss may indicate that the infant is bleeding into the brain.
-	Weight gain indicates that treatment can be stopped.
-	Weight gain indicates that the infant is well.

How often should routine observations be made on a sick infant?
-	Every 5 minutes
-	Every 15 minutes
+	Every 30 minutes
-	Every 60 minutes

An important sign of shock in a newborn infant is:
+	A low blood pressure
-	Sweating
-	Central cyanosis
-	Hypothermia

What is a normal capillary filling time?
-	1 second or less
+	3 seconds or less
-	5 seconds or less
-	More than 5 seconds

An important cause of shock in newborn infants is:
-	Hypothermia
-	Anaemia
+	Hypoxia
-	Hyperbilirubinaemia

Which of the following fluids should be used to treat shock?
-	5% dextrose
-	10% dextrose
-	Neonatalyte
+	Normal saline

An important cause of fits in newborn infants is:
+	Hypoglycaemia
-	Hypothermia
-	Preterm delivery
-	Cephalhaematoma

Which drug should be used to stop a fit?
-	Penicillin
-	Pethidine
+	Phenobarbitone
-	Hydroxyzine (Aterax)

The pH of the blood is measured with:
-	Indicator strips
-	A thermometer
-	A pulse oximeter in the nursery
+	A blood gas analyser in a laboratory

The umbilical arterial pH of the blood in a newborn infant is:
-	7.20–7.30
+	7.30–7.40
-	7.40–7.50
-	7.50–7.60

What measurement suggests that a low pH is caused by a metabolic acidosis?
-	High PaCO₂
-	Normal PaCO₂
+	Base deficit greater than 5
-	Base deficit less than 5

What is used to correct metabolic acidosis?
-	Phototherapy
+	4% sodium bicarbonate
-	Improved ventilation
-	10% glucose

The correct management of respiratory acidosis is:
-	Observe the infant with an apnoea monitor.
-	Give the infant oxygen in a headbox.
-	Give the infant 4% sodium bicarbonate by intravenous infusion.
+	Ventilate the infant.
