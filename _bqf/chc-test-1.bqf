What is the first step in the general examination of a child?
+	Introduce yourself.
-	Take a brief history.
-	Do a physical examination.
-	Get a chest X-ray.

How should you address a child?
-	Speak to the mother rather than to the child.
-	It is best to call all children ‘kid’ so that you do not frighten them.
+	Speak directly to the child using the child’s name.
-	It is better if a nurse rather than a doctor speaks to the child.

Is it important to listen to what mothers have to say?
+	Yes, as the mother knows the child best.
-	Yes, as the mother will be paying for the visit.
-	No, as the mother expects you to tell her what the symptoms are.
-	No, as mothers do not give an accurate history.

What is the value of a referral letter?
-	Of little value as the information is often incorrect.
-	Only important if it was written by a doctor.

+	Helpful in drawing your attention to the presenting problem.

The Road-to-Health Card should be asked for:

How should you measure a child’s temperature?
+	The axillary temperature is best in young children.
-	The oral temperature should be recorded in all children.

Who should give the history?
+	The child if possible.

An immunisation history is important:
-	Only in children from a poor home.
-	Only in children younger than 3 years.
-	If the child attends a clinic but not needed for hospital admissions.
+	Important for all children.

A social history should be taken:
-	Only if you suspect child abuse.
+	Always, as the home situation is often the cause of the child’s problem.
-	Always, as you need not examine the child if there is an obvious social problem.
-	Only in children who are not able to give a history themselves.

How should you start a physical examination?
+	With a general inspection of the child.
-	Always listen to the heart first before the child starts to cry.
