title: Birth Defects. Test 1. Introduction to birth defects


How high is the prevalence of birth defects in developing countries?
-	10/1000 live births.
-	30/1000 live births.
+	80/1000 live births.
-	120/1000 live births.

How many chromosomes are found in the cells of the human body?
-	22
-	23
-	44
+	46

Females have:
-	One X chromosome.
-	One Y chromosome.
+	Two X chromosomes.
-	No X chromosomes.

Ova and sperms are also called sex cells or:
-	Zygotes.
-	Embryos.
+	Gametes.
-	Genes.

What is trisomy?
+	An extra chromosome.
-	An extra three chromosomes.
-	A missing chromosome.
-	An extra gene.

Trisomy is usually due to:
-	Translocation.
+	Non-disjunction.
-	Deletion.
-	Mosaicism.

What is an example of monosomy?
-	Down syndrome.
-	Edward syndrome.
-	Patau syndrome.
+	Turner syndrome.

What is a gene?
+	A small package of DNA.
-	A group of chromosomes.
-	A fertilised egg.
-	A pair of chromosomes.

What are alleles?
+	A pair of similar genes.
-	Single chromosomes.
-	A substance that damages a fetus.
-	A defect in a single gene.

What is a mutation?
+	A change in the structure of a gene.
-	An increased number of genes.
-	A decreased number of genes.
-	It has nothing to do with genes.

What is the chance of inheriting a dominant gene present in one parent?
-	There is a 25% chance of inheriting the gene.
+	There is a 50% chance of inheriting the gene.
-	Only females pass on the gene.
-	Only males pass on the gene.

What is a recessive gene?
-	A ‘stronger’ gene.
+	A ‘weaker’ gene.
-	A female gene.
-	Always an abnormal gene.

A person who has a dominant and a recessive gene for a particular physical feature or function is called:
-	A female.
-	Homozygous.
+	Heterozygous.
-	A twin.

If both parents are carriers of a recessive gene, the chance of their infant inheriting both recessive genes is:
-	1:1 (i.e. 100%).
-	1:2 (i.e. 50%).
+	1:4 (i.e. 25%).
-	1:10 (i.e. 10%).

Name the type of inheritance if a recessive gene is carried by females and only passed on to their male infants:
-	Dominant inheritance.
-	Recessive inheritance.
-	Y-linked inheritance.
+	X-linked inheritance.

What clinical disorder is caused by a single gene defect?
-	Cystic fibrosis.
-	Down syndrome.
-	Fetal alcohol syndrome.
+	Club feet.

Which of the following conditions are caused by a multifactorial inheritance?
-	Neurofibromatosis.
+	Neural tube defect.
-	Thalassaemia.
-	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD).

What is a teratogen?
-	An abnormal chromosome.
-	An abnormal gene.
+	Something that damages the developing organism.
-	Something that damages a gene.

When do teratogens have the most effect?
-	The pre-implantation phase.
+	The embryonic phase.
-	The fetal phase.
-	After birth.

Which of the following is a teratogen?
-	The X-chromosome.
-	A recessive gene.
-	A translocation.
+	Rubella virus.
