title: Child Healthcare. Test 15. Childhood mortality


The under-5 mortality rate is expressed as the number of infants who die under the age of 5 years per:
-	100 live births.
+	1000 live births.
-	100 000 live births.
-	1 million live births.

The infant mortality rate includes all infants who die under the age of:
-	1 week.
-	1 month.
+	1 year.
-	3 years.

How is mortality rate best expressed?
-	Deaths per month.
-	Deaths per 6 months.
+	Deaths per year.
-	Deaths per 10 years.

It is best to calculate the mortality rate:
-	For each hospital separately.
-	For all the clinics in a health district combined.
-	For the hospital and all the clinics in a health region combined.
+	For the whole region which is serviced by that hospital and those clinics.

Why is it important to know the under-5 mortality rate?
+	It is one of the best methods of assessing the wellbeing of children.
-	It is important for medicolegal reasons.
-	It is important for political reasons.
-	It is important to motivate for more paediatrically trained nurses.

What determines the under-5 mortality rate?
-	The gross national income.
-	The number of private doctors in the country.
+	The health, nutrition and home environment of children.
-	The number of tertiary hospitals.

What is the under-5 mortality rate in most well resourced countries?
-	Less than 5
+	Less than 10
-	Less than 50
-	Less than 100.	

What is the estimated under-5 mortality rate in South Africa?
-	15
-	30
+	70
-	90

Which childhood deaths should be notified?
+	All childhood deaths.
-	Only deaths in hospital.
-	Deaths in all hospitals and clinics.
-	Only deaths where the cause is known.

When is the best time to record the clinical details after a child has died?
+	As soon as possible after the death.
-	When the patient’s hospital notes are summarised.
-	Only after the post mortem examination.
-	Only after the death has been fully discussed.

What is the best way of determining the cause of childhood deaths?
-	A doctor should examine all dead children.
-	A post mortem examination should be done on all dead children.
+	All childhood deaths should be discussed at a mortality meeting.
-	All very ill children should be admitted to hospital to die.

What is the aim of mortality meetings?
-	To discipline the staff.
+	To decide the cause of death and identify modifiable factors.
-	To lecture the staff on the common causes of death.
-	To collect accurate data for the annual hospital report.

What is an important benefit of a mortality meeting?
-	It saves having to summarise all the notes while writing a death report.
-	It avoids doctors or nurses being sued for malpractice.
+	It is an excellent opportunity to learn.
-	It saves having to have staff meetings.

Who at a mortality meeting should decide why the child died?
-	The most senior doctor.
-	The hospital administrator.
-	The doctor and nurse who last cared for the child.
+	Everyone who attends the meeting.

What is a modifiable factor?
-	An example of good care.
+	A missed opportunity or substandard care.
-	Part of care that only doctors can provide.
-	Something which cannot be corrected.

Modifiable factors:
-	Are always related to the family or caregiver.
-	Are never related to the clinical personnel.
-	Are the responsibility of the administration.
+	May be due to factors relating to the family, staff or administration.

What is the commonest cause of under-5 deaths in South Africa (and most developing countries)?
+	Infection.
-	Malnutrition.
-	Violence.
-	Cancer.

How will AIDS affect the under-5 mortality in developing countries?
-	Very little as there are so many other causes.
-	It should make little difference as children are unlikely to become infected with HIV.
-	It may increase the number of deaths in the towns and cities only.
+	It will cause a marked increase in the mortality rate.

When should the HIV status be assessed in childhood deaths?
-	It is not routinely recorded as most ill children do not have an HIV screening test.
-	It is not needed if the cause of death is already known.
+	It should always be assessed clinically if screening tests have not been done.
-	Blood tests for HIV should be done on all dead children.

The nutritional status should be assessed and recorded:
+	In all childhood deaths.
-	Only if the child came from a poor home or was neglected.
-	Only if the child died of infection such as TB or diarrhoea.
-	Only if the child had not routinely attended clinic.
