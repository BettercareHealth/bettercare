title: Perinatal HIV. Test 1. Introduction to perinatal HIV


What is HIV?
+	A retrovirus
-	A herpes virus
-	The human influenza virus
-	The cause of syphilis

What is AIDS?
+	A serious illness caused by a virus
-	A fatal disease whose cause is unknown
-	A common cause of abnormal sexual behaviour
-	An acute bacterial illness transmitted by sexual intercourse

You can become infected with HIV by:
-	Sharing a cup or plate
-	Social kissing
+	Unprotected sexual intercourse
-	Donating blood

Which body secretions may contain large amounts of HIV?
-	Urine
-	Stool
+	Blood
-	Saliva

Which blood tests are usually used to screen adults for HIV infection?
-	VDRL or RPR
+	ELISA or rapid test
-	PCR or p24 antigen
-	TPHA or FTA

Common features of the acute illness following HIV infection (acute seroconversion illness) are:
-	Blood and protein in the urine
-	Vaginal or urethral discharge
-	Anaemia and jaundice
+	Sore throat and rash

Usually the latent phase between the time of HIV infection and developing AIDS in adults is:
-	Two to four weeks
-	Six to 12 months
-	One to five years
+	Five to 15 years

What are the most common signs of symptomatic HIV infection in adults?
+	Weight loss and chronic diarrhoea
-	Oedema and heart failure
-	Cyanosis and wheezing
-	Jaundice and abdominal distension

What is an important opportunistic infection in AIDS?
-	Syphilis
+	Pneumocystis
-	Measles
-	Influenza

AIDS can be cured?
-	Always
-	Often
-	Sometimes
+	Never

What other disease can increase the risk of becoming infected with HIV?
-	Tuberculosis
-	Kaposi’s sarcoma
+	Syphilis
-	Influenza

HIV is infectious:
-	Only during the first few weeks after infection
-	During the latent phase when the patient feels well
-	Only when the signs of AIDS appear
+	At any time after infection

How does HIV damage the immune system?
+	By destroying CD4 lymphocytes
-	By reducing the number of CD8 lymphocytes
-	By lowering the levels of antibody
-	By interfering with the function of the polymorphs

What type of drugs are nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV)?
-	Antibiotics
-	Protease inhibitors
+	Non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors
-	Nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors

What is a common minor side effect of zidovudine (AZT)?
-	Tinnitus (ringing sound in the ears)
-	Sore throat
+	Nausea and vomiting
-	Rash

What drug is commonly used to prevent an opportunistic infection?
-	Penicillin
+	Co-trimoxazole (Septran, Bactrim, Purbac)
-	Nystatin (mycostatin)
-	Streptomycin

What is the management of a patient with AIDS?
-	Management does not alter the course of the disease and, therefore, is not recommended.
-	These patients should not be treated as it is too expensive.
+	Management with ARV drugs can make a big difference to the quality of the patient’s life.
-	HIV patients should be sent home to die quickly as treatment only prolongs their suffering.

How can healthcare workers reduce the risk of HIV infection?
-	By refusing to care for AIDS patients
-	By washing their hands after touching patients with HIV infection
-	By wearing masks and gowns when caring for patients with HIV infection
+	By adopting universal precautions

What is the correct handling of sharps to avoid accidental injury?
+	Use a sharps container
-	Always resheath a needle after it has been used
-	Always wipe a needle with alcohol after it has been used
-	Only clear away the needle after the procedure has been completed

What prophylaxis should be given to a healthcare worker after an accidental needle-stick injury when collecting blood from an HIV-positive patient?
-	Penicillin should be given immediately
+	Truvada and Aluvia should be started within two hours
-	Hepatitis A vaccine should be given within 72 hours
-	Co-trimoxazole
