title: Childhood TB. Test 5. Preventing childhood tuberculosis


What is BCG?
-	A vaccine made from dead TB bacilli
+	A vaccine made from live, weakened TB bacilli
-	A vaccine made from the protein of TB bacilli
-	A vaccine made from the serum of people with tuberculosis

BCG immunisation is of particular value in reducing the risk of:
-	All forms of tuberculosis
-	Pulmonary tuberculosis
-	Tuberculous lymphadenopathy (TB of lymph nodes)
+	Tuberculous meningitis

BCG should be given:
-	Only to infants weighing 2500 g or more at birth
-	Only if there is a history of tuberculosis in the family
-	Only to infants who have mothers that are not infected with HIV
+	To all infants after birth

How should BCG be given?
+	Intradermally
-	Subcutaneously
-	Intramuscularly
-	Intravenously

Disseminated BCG may occur:
-	If BCG is given to low-birth-weight infants
+	If BCG is given to HIV-infected infants
-	If BCG is given subcutaneously
-	If BCG is not stored in a cool place

BCG commonly causes:
+	A small nodule or ulcer at the site of the immunisation
-	Enlarged axillary lymph node greater than 3 cm
-	Mild pulmonary tuberculosis which heals spontaneously
-	BCG IRIS

How should you screen other members of a household if one of them has tuberculosis?
-	Take a chest X-ray of the children only
-	Take a chest X-ray of all family members
+	Examining a sputum sample only from members who have symptoms of tuberculosis
-	Examining a sputum sample of all family members

Exposure to TB bacilli should be reduced by:
-	Preventing grandparents from living in the same house as their grandchildren
+	Improving living conditions with better housing and nutrition
-	Keeping all the windows closed to prevent coughing due to cold air
-	Not sending young children to creches and ‘play schools’

Contact tracing should be done:
-	Only if a family member has multi-drug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis
-	Only if a family member has tuberculous meningitis
-	If there are young children in the family
+	In all cases of tuberculosis

To avoid spreading TB bacilli to the members of the community, adults with pulmonary tuberculosis should:
-	Be isolated for the first month of treatment
+	Be taught to cough into a handkerchief (cough etiquette)
-	Not be allowed onto buses or trains
-	Not be allowed into a clinic or hospital

Once anti-TB treatment is started, patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are probably no longer infectious after:
-	24 to 48 hours
-	Five days
-	One week
+	Two weeks

How can health workers avoid infection while examining a patient with possible tuberculosis?
-	Wear gloves
+	Ensure good ventilation in the examining room
-	Switch on the lights in the room to kill TB bacilli
-	Spend an hour in the sunshine each day

What is TB prophylaxis for children?
-	Daily vitamin D for a month
-	Treatment with three anti-TB drugs for two weeks
+	Daily INH for six months
-	INH five times a week for three months

Which children should receive TB prophylaxis if exposed to an adult with untreated pulmonary tuberculosis:
-	All children
-	Children under the age of ten years
+	Children under the age of five years
-	Only children under the age of two years

TB prophylaxis in young children should only be given if the Mantoux skin test:
-	Is negative in a child who does not have HIV infection
-	Is intermediate
+	Is positive
-	Is ulcerating

Which children with tuberculosis must be reported?
+	All children
-	Only children with pulmonary tuberculosis
-	Only children with tuberculous meningitis or disseminated tuberculosis
-	Only children under five years of age

Do children receiving TB prophylaxis need to be reported to the authorities?
-	Yes
-	Only if they are under two years of age
-	Only if they also have HIV infection
+	No

The 6th Millennium Development Goal aims at:
-	Preventing all new cases of tuberculosis by 2020
+	Preventing all childhood cases of tuberculosis by 2020
-	Halving the number of cases of tuberculosis by 2015
-	Reducing the number of cases of tuberculosis by 10% each year

Community education is needed to reducing the incidence of tuberculosis:
-	Only in communities where tuberculosis is very common
-	Only in community where multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis occurs
-	Only in communities where HIV infection is common
+	In all communities

Traditional beliefs about tuberculosis:
-	Are always correct
+	Should be corrected by education
-	Should be ignored
-	Are never correct
