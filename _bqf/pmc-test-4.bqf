title: Primary Maternal Care. Test 4. Antepartum haemorrhage


What is the definition of an antepartum haemorrhage?
-	Any vaginal haemorrhage between conception and delivery.
-	Any vaginal haemorrhage during labour.
+	Any vaginal haemorrhage between 24 weeks gestation and delivery.
-	Any vaginal haemorrhage between 24 weeks and the onset of labour.

Antepartum haemorrhage is an important complication of pregnancy because:
-	It is a common cause of iron-deficiency anaemia.
-	The fetus may become anaemic.
-	It may be due to cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia.
+	Both the mother and fetus may die.

Which of the following is an important sign of shock due to blood loss?
+	A fast pulse rate.
-	A low haemoglobin concentration.
-	Concentrated urine.
-	Pyrexia.

The initial management of a shocked patient with an antepartum haemorrhage is:
-	A speculum examination to rule out a local cause for the antepartum haemorrhage.
-	An ultrasound examination must be done in order to localise the placenta.
-	Assess whether there is engagement of the fetal head as this could rule out a placenta praevia.
+	Put up two intravenous infusions to run in quickly.

The amount of bleeding to diagnose an antepartum haemorrhage is:
+	A sanitary pad is at least partly soaked with blood.
-	A blood-stained vaginal discharge is present.
-	A small amount of blood mixed with mucus has been passed.
-	Any one of above-mentioned is present.

Why is a speculum examination done on a patient with an antepartum haemorrhage?
-	To see how dilated the cervix is.
-	To exclude a placenta praevia before a digital examination is done.
+	To exclude a local cause of the bleeding from the vagina or cervix.
-	To look for a blood clot in the vagina.

If a speculum examination is done on a patient with a history suggestive of a blood-stained discharge, what finding would diagnose an antepartum haemorrhage?
+	Bleeding from a closed cervical os.
-	A blood-stained discharge seen in the vagina.
-	Contact bleeding when the speculum touches the cervix.
-	Bulging membranes through a partially dilated cervix.

What is the most likely cause of a massive antepartum haemorrhage that threatens the mother’s life?
-	Abruptio placentae.
-	Rupture of the uterus.
-	Cervical carcinoma.
+	Placenta praevia.

Which of the following factors will place a patient at the highest risk of abruptio placentae?
+	A history of abruptio placentae in a previous pregnancy.
-	Any of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
-	Intra-uterine growth restriction.
-	Cigarette smoking.

Which of the following would suggest an abruptio placentae?
+	The uterus is tonically contracted and tender.
-	Fetal movements are usually present.
-	The haemoglobin concentration is low.
-	The uterus is relaxed and the fetal heart rate is normal.

An antepartum haemorrhage with no fetal heart heard is usually caused by:
-	Placenta praevia.
+	Abruptio placentae.
-	Antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause.
-	Trichomonal vaginitis.

Which of the following patients is at an increased risk of placenta praevia?
-	A patient with one of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
+	A patient with a multiple pregnancy.
-	A patient with intra-uterine growth restriction.
-	A patient who smokes.

What symptoms point to the diagnosis of placenta praevia?
+	The bleeding is painless.
-	The bleeding consists of dark red blood clots.
-	The bleeding is associated with severe continuous abdominal pain.
-	Fetal movement is absent after the bleed.

Vaginal bleeding due to placenta praevia is usually associated with:
-	Fetal parts that are difficult to feel and an absent fetal heart beat.
-	Engagement of the fetal head.
+	A uterus that is relaxed and not tender on palpation.
-	Lower abdominal pain.

In which of the following patients can placenta praevia be excluded?
-	A patient with a slight vaginal bleed.
+	When two fifths or less of the fetal head can be palpated above the pelvic brim on abdominal examination.
-	A patient with a painless, bright red vaginal bleed.
-	A patient with a breech presentation.

What action should you take if a routine ultrasound examination early in pregnancy shows a placenta praevia?
+	A repeat ultrasound examination must be arranged at 32 weeks.
-	No further investigations are required.
-	Book the patient for an elective Caesarean section at 38 weeks.
-	Refer the patient to hospital where she will be admitted.

How will a patient describe a blood-stained vaginal discharge?
-	A vaginal bleed that soaks a sanitary towel.
-	A slight bleed consisting of blood mixed with mucus.
+	A vaginal discharge mixed with a small amount of blood.
-	Bleeding after intercourse.

Which of the following is typical of a ‘show’?
-	A heavy vaginal bleed.
+	A slight bleed consisting of blood mixed with mucus.
-	A mucoid vaginal discharge.
-	Blood in the urine.

What would you find on speculum examination with a history of a ‘show’?
+	The cervix is a few centimetres dilated and the membranes are bulging.
-	The bleeding will come through a closed cervical os.
-	An offensive vaginal discharge.
-	Contact bleeding will occur if the cervix is touched.

How should you manage a patient who presents at 30 weeks of gestation with a blood-stained vaginal discharge which is caused by vaginitis?
-	The urine should be tested with a reagent strip for protein, nitrites and leucocytes.
-	A cytology smear must be taken from the cervix to identify the organism causing the vaginitis.
-	A vaginal examination should be done in theatre as with any other patient who presents with an antepartum haemorrhage.
+	The patient and her partner must be treated with metronidazole (Flagyl).
