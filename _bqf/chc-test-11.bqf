What is an important complication of severe hookworm infection?
-	Rectal prolapse.
+	Iron deficiency anaemia.
-	Severe malnutrition.
-	Haematuria (blood in the urine).

Tapeworm infection is common:
-	In areas where children swim in dams and rivers.
+	In families where partially cooked pork is eaten.
-	In towns where dogs are kept as pets.
-	In rural areas where pigs are allowed to eat human faeces.

Neurocysticercosis (many small cysts in the brain) results from:
+	Swallowing the eggs of the pork tapeworm.
-	Human infection with the sheep or goat tapeworm.
-	Ear infection with maggots (fly larvae).
-	Pneumocystis infection.

What is an important sign of Giardia infection?
-	Itching of the skin.
-	Severe vomiting and dehydration.
+	Diarrhoea.
-	Blood in the stools.

Amoebiasis is an important cause of:
-	Renal failure.
+	Dysentery.

-	Pain and difficulty passing urine, especially at night.
+	Blood in the urine towards the end of micturition (passing urine).

The clinical diagnosis of malaria can be confirmed by:
+	Staining a thick blood smear.
-	Examining a spun deposit of urine.
-	Measuring the serum bilirubin concentration.
-	Determining the packed cell volume or haemoglobin concentration.

A dangerous feature of severe malaria is:
-	Oedema of the face and ankles.
-	Hypertension.
+	A depressed level of consciousness.
-	A high blood glucose concentration.

Uncomplicated malaria should be treated with:
-	Intravenous quinine plus clindamycin.
+	Oral Coartem.
-	Oral chloroquine alone.
-	A single dose of intramuscular tetracycline.

What is the best way of preventing malaria?
-	Take prophylactic drugs for the time you are in the malaria region.
+	Prevent mosquito bites.
-	Only visit malaria regions in the rainy season.
-	Prevention is not needed for people who live in malaria regions as they rapidly become immune to malaria.

The recommended malaria prophylaxis for young children under 10 kg is:
+	Malanil (atovaquone plus proguanil).
-	Doxycycline.
-	Chloroquine.
-	Coartem.
