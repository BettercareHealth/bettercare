title: Childhood TB. Test 3. Diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis


The clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis in children:
-	Is usually easy to confirm
-	Can be confirmed with a few special investigations
+	Is often difficult to confirm
-	Usually cannot be confirmed

What is used in a Mantoux skin test?
-	Live TB bacilli
+	Tuberculin
-	Serum from a patient with tuberculosis
-	Serum from a patient who has been cured of tuberculosis

The Mantoux skin test is done:
-	Intravenously
-	Intramuscularly
-	Subcutaneously
+	Intradermally

When should a Mantoux skin test be read?
-	Immediately
-	At 24 hours
+	Between 48 and 72 hours
-	After five days

A Mantoux skin test is positive when:
-	The area of induration is 0 to 4 mm.
-	The area of induration is 5 to 9 mm.
+	The area of induration is 10 mm or more.
-	The area of redness is 15 mm or more.

What does a positive Mantoux skin test indicate?
-	The child has tuberculosis
-	The child is immune to tuberculosis
-	The child is malnourished
+	The child has been infected with TB bacilli

A negative Mantoux skin test is unreliable in:
-	Boys
-	Older children
+	Children with HIV infection
-	Children with mild undernutrition

How is a sputum sample obtained in a young child?
-	By asking the child to cough.
+	By gastric aspirate.
-	By suctioning the nose
-	By collecting saliva

Do sputum samples usually contain many TB bacilli in children with tuberculosis?
-	Always
-	Usually they do
+	Usually they do not
-	Never in children

How can staff protect themselves against TB infection when collecting sputum?
+	Receive BCG immunisation
-	Take a short course of INH
-	Wear a N95 respirator
-	Keep all the windows closed

A sputum smear is usually stained for TB bacilli with:
-	Ziehl-Neelsen stain
-	Gramâ€™s stain
+	Indian ink stain
-	Aniline stain

How long does it take to get a sputum culture result with liquid culture medium?
-	Less than one week
-	One to two weeks
+	Two to three weeks
-	More than one month

What is the most sensitive test on sputum for TB bacilli?
-	Staining the smear
-	Measuring the pH
-	A Heaf test
+	Culture

A chest X-ray is:
-	Essential to diagnose tuberculosis
+	Very useful in diagnosing tuberculosis in children
-	Only useful in adults with tuberculosis who have lung cavities
-	No longer needed with modern sputum tests

The commonest chest X-ray finding in children with tuberculosis is:
+	Enlarged hilar lymph nodes
-	The primary infection in the lung
-	Consolidation of the upper lobe of a lung
-	Bronchiectasis

Many small spots throughout both lungs on a chest X-ray suggests:
-	Primary TB infection
-	Pleural effusion
+	Miliary tuberculosis
-	Patchy bronchopneumonia

Fine needle aspiration is useful when diagnosing tuberculosis in:
-	The spleen
+	Enlarged lymph nodes
-	The lung
-	The spine

When should a lumbar puncture be performed?
-	Only in children with disseminated tuberculosis
-	If spinal tuberculosis is suspected
+	To confirm a clinical diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis
-	If the Mantoux skin test is positive in an infant

When should children with tuberculosis be screened for HIV?
+	All children suspected of having tuberculosis must be screened
-	Only in infants
-	Only in sexually active adolescents
-	Screening for HIV is not necessary

What test should be used when diagnosing HIV infection in a child under 18 moths of age with tuberculosis?
-	Rapid HIV test
-	ELISA HIV test
-	HIV Western blot test
+	HIV PCR test
