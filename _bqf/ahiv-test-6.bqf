title: Adult HIV. Test 6. HIV-associated infections


Which is a common HIV-associated infection?
-	Chicken pox
+	Tuberculosis
-	Syphilis

What is an ‘AIDS-defining’ illness?
-	An infection which occurs at any stage of HIV infection
-	An infection which is common in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients
+	An infection which indicates stage 4 disease
-	A rash suggesting a diagnosis of acute seroconversion illness

Secondary prophylaxis is important in patients who have had:
-	Oesophageal candidiasis
+	Cryptococcal meningitis
-	Kaposi’s sarcoma
-	Aphthous ulcers

Oral candidiasis is treated with:
-	Penicillin
-	Local steroids (e.g. Kenalog in Orobase)
+	Topical nystatin drops
-	AZT

Which organisms may cause diarrhoea in HIV patients?
-	Staphylococcus
+	Non-typhoid Salmonella
-	Candida
-	Toxoplasma

Cryptosporidium may cause:
-	Severe headaches and convulsion
-	White patches in the mouth
-	Chronic cough
+	Chronic diarrhoea

What is shingles?
-	Severe seborrhoea of the scalp
-	A common side effect of nevirapine
+	A painful rash caused by Varicella zoster
-	Bilateral enlargement of the parotids

What is a common cause of a sore mouth in HIV patients?
-	Oral hairy leucoplakia
+	Herpes infection
-	Tuberculosis
-	Streptococcal infections

Recurrent genital herpes with large ulcers should be treated with:
-	Topical nystatin
-	Local fluconazole
+	Oral acyclovir
-	Penicillin

How does oesophageal candidiasis present?
+	Difficult and painful swallowing
-	Vomiting blood
-	A vaginal discharge
-	Ulcers in the mouth

Oesophageal candidiasis should be treated with:
-	Gentian violet
+	Oral fluconazole
-	Local nystatin
-	Metronidazole (Flagyl)

Pneumocystis infection presents with:
-	Diarrhoea
-	Rash
-	Meningitis
+	Pneumonia

Pneumocystis should be treated with:
+	Oral co-trimoxazole
-	Ampicillin and gentamicin
-	Anti-TB medication, especially INH
-	Intravenous acyclovir

The diagnosis of Cryptococcal infection is confirmed by examining the:
-	Chest X-ray
+	Cerebrospinal fluid
-	Urine
-	Brain scan

Sudden blindness in HIV patients is usually caused by an infection with:
-	Cryptococcus
-	Toxoplasmosis
+	Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
-	Herpes simplex

Tuberculosis is common in HIV patients:
-	Only when they are clinically ill
-	Only when the CD4 count is lower than 200 cells/µl
-	Only when the CD4 count is lower than 50 cells/µl
+	At any time during HIV infection

Tuberculosis:
-	Usually presents as meningitis in HIV-positive patients
-	Can be prevented with co-trimoxazole prophylaxis
-	Slows down the progression of HIV
+	Is a common cause of death in HIV patients

How is the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis usually confirmed?
-	By doing a brain scan
+	By examining the sputum
-	By performing a Mantoux skin test
-	By performing a full blood count

Should HIV infection and tuberculosis be treated at the same time?
+	Start the anti-TB treatment first.
-	Treat the HIV infection first for six months before starting the anti-TB treatment.
-	There is no problem with treating the HIV infection and tuberculosis at the same time.
-	Start the antiretroviral and anti-TB treatments together but also give the patient large doses of steroids for the first three months.

Drugs used to treat HIV and tuberculosis may both cause:
-	Haemolytic anaemia
-	Cancer
