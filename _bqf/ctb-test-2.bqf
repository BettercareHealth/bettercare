title: Childhood TB. Test 2. Clinical presentation of childhood tuberculosis


A high index of suspicion:
+	Is important in making the correct diagnosis of tuberculosis
-	Is only useful in diagnosing tuberculosis in older children
-	Is only helpful in children with severe malnutrition
-	Is not helpful in diagnosing tuberculosis

The most important step in making a clinical diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis is:
+	A careful history
-	A general examination
-	Listening to chest with a stethoscope
-	Special investigations

What is an early symptom of tuberculosis?
-	Shortness of breath
-	Coughing blood
-	A severe headache
+	Poor weight gain

Children with tuberculosis may present to the clinic with:
-	Sudden weight gain and oedema
+	A fever that fails to respond to antibiotics
-	A peeling rash of the hands and feet
-	Blood-stained urine

Children presenting with tuberculosis have usually been unwell for:
-	Less than 24 hours
-	Only a few days
+	A few weeks
-	At least three months

A common symptom of pulmonary tuberculosis in children is:
-	Chest pain
+	Persistent cough lasting more than two weeks
-	Night sweats
-	Difficulty breathing

On clinical examination, young children with pulmonary tuberculosis often have:
-	Severe chest indrawing
-	Neck stiffness
-	Decreased air entry and dullness on one side of the chest
+	No abnormal clinical signs

A typical sign of tuberculous pneumonia is:
+	Fast breathing
-	Wheeze
-	Stridor
-	Central cyanosis

Enlarged lymph nodes due to tuberculosis usually are:
-	Not tender
-	Tender
-	Soft
+	Firm and matted

A complication of enlarged tuberculous nodes in the neck is:
-	Cancer
+	Abscess and fistula formation
-	Bleeding
-	Compression of the airway

What is a common cause of mildly enlarged axillary lymph nodes in young children?
-	Lymphoma
-	Tuberculosis
+	BCG
-	Leukaemia

An early sign of tuberculous meningitis is:
+	Drowsiness in an ill child
-	Convulsions
-	Loss of vision
-	Very high temperature

A late sign of tuberculous meningitis is:
-	Headache
+	Weakness of one side of the body (paralysis)
-	Irritability
-	Rash

What is a common sign of abdominal tuberculosis?
-	Rectal bleeding
-	Diarrhoea
+	Abdominal distension
-	Weight gain

What joints are often affected by bone tuberculosis?
+	The knee
-	The small joints of the hand
-	The jaw
-	The bones of the feet

Bone tuberculosis usually develops:
-	At the same time as the primary TB infection
-	Six to eight weeks after the primary infection
-	Six months after the primary infection
+	Many years after the primary infection

Spinal tuberculosis usually presents with:
-	A local deformity of the back due to collapse of a vertebra
+	Local pain and tenderness
-	Paralysis of both legs
-	Constipation

Disseminated tuberculosis is more likely in:
-	Newborn infants
-	Children over the age of five years
+	Children who have HIV infection
-	Children with iron-deficiency anaemia

With miliary tuberculosis:
-	Children have usually received BCG immunisation
+	TB infection has spread throughout both lungs
-	Children are usually not generally ill
-	The chest X-ray is normal

Scoring systems to identify children with tuberculosis:
-	Are essential to make the diagnosis
-	Can be used instead of sputum examination
-	Can be used instead of a chest X-ray
+	Are not very accurate
