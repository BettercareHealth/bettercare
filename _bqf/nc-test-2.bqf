title: Newborn Care. Test 2. Assessing gestational age and size at birth


Gestation is measured from:
-	The day of conception
-	The day the mother first feels fetal movement
+	The first day of the mother’s last normal menstrual period
-	The day of the mother’s first developed symptoms of pregnancy

What is the average gestational age at birth?
-	37 weeks
-	38 weeks
+	40 weeks
-	42 weeks

An infant with a gestational age of 37 weeks is called:
+	Term
-	Preterm
-	Postterm
-	Low birth weight

A preterm infant is defined as an infant with a gestational age:
-	Less than 35 weeks
-	Less than 36 weeks
+	Less than 37 weeks
-	Less than 38 weeks

Postterm infants have a gestational age of:
+	42 weeks or more
-	41 weeks or more
-	40 weeks or more
-	38 weeks or more

The gestational age can be estimated after delivery by:
-	Weighing the infant
-	Measuring the infant’s head circumference
-	Measuring the infant’s haemoglobin concentration
+	Examining the infant’s physical features and assessing the neurological behaviour

Infants that are born preterm have an increased incidence of:
-	Meconium aspiration syndrome
-	Wasting
+	Hypothermia
-	Pyrexia

Which of the following infants should have their weight measured after delivery?
-	Infants that appear to be preterm
-	Infants that are wasted
-	Infants that appear clinically ill
+	All infants

Postterm infants are at an increased risk of:
-	Hyaline membrane disease
-	Anaemia
-	Feeding difficulties
+	Birth trauma

Most newborn infants weigh between:
-	2000 g and 2500 g
+	2500 g and 4000 g
-	3500 g and 4000 g
-	4000 g and 4500 g

Low birth weight infants weigh:
-	Less than 3000 g
+	Less than 2500 g
-	Less than 2000 g
-	Less than 1500 g

Most infants have a birth weight that falls:
-	Above the 90th centile
+	Between the 10th and 90th centiles
-	Below the 10th centile
-	Below the 3rd centile

Infants that are underweight for gestational age have a birth weight that falls:
-	Below the 90th centile
-	Between the 10th and 90th centiles
+	Below the 10th centile
-	Below the 3rd centile

Overweight for gestational age infants are often born to mothers with:
-	Hypertension
-	Syphilis
-	Rubella
+	Diabetes

Intra-uterine growth restriction usually results in:
-	Only weight below the 10th centile at birth
+	Both weight and head circumference below the 10th centile at birth
-	Only head circumference below the 10th centile
-	Postterm delivery

Wasting in the newborn infant is usually the result of:
-	Infection
+	Fetal undernutrition in the last weeks of pregnancy
-	Preterm delivery
-	Maternal diabetes

Loose, wrinkled, dry skin and loss of muscle in an infant at birth suggests:
+	Wasting
-	Preterm delivery
-	Rhesus disease
-	Septicaemia

Infants that are wasted at birth:
-	Are usually overweight for gestational age
-	Are always postterm
+	May be appropriate for gestational age at term
-	Are always low birth weight

Wasted infants are at an increased risk of:
+	Hypoglycaemia
-	Birth trauma
-	Hyaline membrane disease
-	Infection

Which of the following is the best predictor of problems in the neonatal period?
-	Gestational age alone
-	Weight alone
-	Weight for gestational age
+	Gestational age together with weight for gestational age
