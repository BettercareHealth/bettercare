title: Birth Defects. Test 6. Neural tube defects


What is a neural tube defect?
-	An abnormality of the peripheral nerves.
+	A malformation of the neural tube.
-	A narrowing or absence of the neural tube.
-	A form of nerve deafness.

Which of the following is an example of a neural tube defect?
+	Meningomyelocoele.
-	Omphalocoele.
-	Microcephaly.
-	All of the above.

With anencephaly:
-	The spine is open in the lumbar and sacral region of the back.
-	Only the membranes bulge out of a defect in the vertebral column.
-	Both the membranes and spinal cord bulge out of the defect in the vertebral column.
+	The top of the skull is open and the malformed brain is exposed.

Infants with anencephaly usually:
+	Die soon after birth.
-	Are operated on after delivery.
-	Are only referred for surgery when they are able to walk.
-	Survive with blindness and deafness.

Which of the following is an open spinal defect?
-	Spina bifida occulta.
-	Encephalocoele.
+	Meningomyelocoele.
-	Hydrocephalus.

The birth prevalence of neural tube defects in South Africa is:
-	10–40/1000.	
+	1–4/1000.	
-	1/ 10 000.	
-	4/ 100 000.	

In South Africa, neural tube defects are commoner in:
-	Urban areas.
+	Rural areas.
-	Older mothers.
-	Teenage mothers.

Most neural tube defects are due to:
-	Autosomal dominant inheritance.
-	Autosomal recessive inheritance.
-	X-linked recessive inheritance.
+	Multifactorial inheritance.

Neural tube defects may occasionally be caused by:
-	High doses of folic acid.
-	Smoking cigarettes.
+	Some anticonvulsants.
-	Taking iron supplements during pregnancy.

Common complications of encephalocoele include:
+	Intellectual disability.
-	Paralysed legs and bladder incontinence.
-	Meningitis.
-	Kyphosis or scoliosis.

Meningomyelocoele commonly results in:
-	Deafness.
+	Club feet.
-	Anencephaly.
-	Blindness.

Meningocoele usually presents with:
-	Paralysed legs.
+	A bulge over the midline of the spine.
-	Incontinence of bladder and bowel.
-	Bed sores.

A spina bifida occulta may be recognised by:
-	A bulge over the lower spine.
-	A large head at birth.
+	A patch of hair in the midline of the lower back.
-	Club feet.

Meningocoele can be corrected with:
+	Surgery.
-	Antibiotics.
-	Neurodevelopmental therapy.
-	Anticonvulsants.

To reduce the risk of neural tube defects, supplementation should be given:
+	Three months before and three months after conception.
-	As soon as pregnancy is diagnosed.
-	Only after the first trimester.
-	Throughout the second half of pregnancy.

What dietary fortification can reduce the risk of neural tube defects?
-	Vitamin A.
-	Vitamin C.
+	Folic acid.
-	Zinc.

What are the risks of a mother having a second child with a neural tube defect?
-	1%.
+	5%.
-	25%.
-	50%.

Which maternal serum screening test helps to identify pregnant women at increased risk of having a child with neural tube defects?
-	Alkaline phosphatase.
-	Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD).
+	Alpha-fetoprotein.
-	Ferritin.

Ultrasound screening for neural tube defects is best done at:
-	10 weeks.
+	18 weeks.
-	26 weeks.
-	36 weeks.

What is the management of a woman who has a fetus with a neural tube defect?
-	Nothing can be done.
-	Amniocentesis.
-	Induction of labour at 36 weeks for early surgery.
+	Genetic counselling.
