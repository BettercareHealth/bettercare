Oculocutaneous albinism, Waardenburg syndrome and haemophilia are inherited as:
+	Single gene defects.
-	Multifactorial disorders.
-	Congenital disorders due to a teratogen.
-	Trisomies.

Waardenburg syndrome is inherited as:
+	An autosomal dominant disorder.
-	An autosomal recessive disorder.
-	An X-linked recessive disorder.
-	A chromosomal abnormality.

What is an important feature of Waardenburg syndrome?
+	Very blue eyes.
-	Pale skin.
-	Intellectual disability.
-	Slow growth.

The main complication of Waardenburg syndrome is:
-	Severe sun damage.
-	Convulsions.
+	Severe deafness.
-	Blindness.

The risk of a child having Waardenburg syndrome if one of the parents is affected is:
-	Very small.
-	25%.
+	50%.
-	100%.

How is oculocutaneous albinism inherited?
-	As an autosomal dominant disorder.
+	As an autosomal recessive disorder.
-	As an X-linked recessive disorder.
-	As a chromosomal abnormality.

How common is oculocutaneous albinism in South Africa?
-	About 1 per 1000 live births.
+	About 1 per 4000 live births.
-	About 1 per 10 000 live births.
-	About 1 per 50 000 live births.

What are the main features of oculocutaneous albinism?
-	Light-coloured eyes only.
-	Pale skin.
-	Both pale skin and light eyes.
+	Pale skin and hair with light eyes.

People with oculocutaneous albinism have serious problems with:
-	Hearing.
+	Vision.
-	Hearing and speech.
-	Hearing, speech and vision.

What is a major complication of oculocutaneous albinism?
+	Skin cancer.
-	Leukaemia.
-	Cancer of the eye.
-	Cancer of the liver.

Patients with oculocutaneous albinism often are:
-	Intellectually disabled.
-	Visually disabled.
+	Crippled due to joint damage.
-	Socially isolated.

Important care in patients with oculocutaneous albinism includes:
+	Sun protection at all times.
-	Prophylactic antibiotics.
-	Special diet high in protein.
-	A hearing aid.

What is the cause of haemophilia?
-	Too few platelets in the blood.
+	Lack of normal blood clotting factors VIII or IX.
-	Too few red cells in the blood.
-	Lack of vitamin K.

Haemophilia is inherited as:
-	An autosomal dominant disorder.
-	An autosomal recessive disorder.
+	An X-linked recessive disorder.
-	A chromosomal abnormality.

Mild haemophilia is seen:
-	Only in boys.
-	Only in girls.
+	Mostly in boys.
-	Mostly in girls.

What blood test can be used to screen for moderate or severe haemophilia?
-	The international Normalised Ratio (INR).
+	The partial thromboplastin time (PTT).
-	A platelet count.
-	The haemoglobin concentration.

What is a common complication of severe haemophilia?
+	Haemarthroses (bleeds into joints).
-	Intracranial haemorrhages.
-	Blood in the stool.
-	Vomiting blood.

What is the management of a child with haemophilia who presents with a haematoma (bleed into a muscle)?
-	Reassure the mother that it will recover over the next week.
-	Place ice over the site of the bleed and give the child two aspirin.
-	Start a blood transfusion.
+	Start a transfusion of factor VIII or IX.

What is the risk for parents who have two sons with haemophilia having another affected child in future pregnancies?
-	Very small.
-	10% if it is a boy.
+	50% if it is a boy.
-	All their future children are likely to be affected.

If the father has haemophilia, what is the risk of his sons having haemophilia also?
+	Nil.
-	1:4.	
-	1:2.
