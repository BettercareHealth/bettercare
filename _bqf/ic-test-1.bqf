title: Intrapartum Care. Test 1. Monitoring the condition of the mother during the first stage of labour


What is a partogram?
-	A chart for recording cervical dilatation only
-	An observation chart to record the clinical findings during the antenatal period
-	A machine to record the fetal heart rate
+	A chart to record the progress of labour together with the maternal and fetal condition

During the first stage of labour a partogram must be used:
+	On all patients
-	Only on high-risk patients
-	Only in level 1 clinics
-	Only in level 2 and 3 hospitals

Which of the following indicates that the general condition of a patient in the first stage of labour is normal?
-	The patient’s temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure are normal.
+	The patient is at ease and relaxed between contractions and does not appear pale.
-	The urine output is normal and ketonuria is not present.
-	The patient’s blood pressure is normal and proteinuria is not present.

The correct management of a 17-year-old primigravida patient who appears very anxious and complains of painful contractions in early labour is:
-	The patient must immediately receive analgesics.
-	A Caesarean section must be done.
+	The patient must be comforted and reassured and receive appropriate analgesia. If possible, someone she knows should stay with her.
-	The membranes must be ruptured to ensure a rapid progress of labour.

What is the normal maternal temperature during labour?
-	35.5–36.0 °C
+	36.0–37.0 °C
-	36.5–37.5 °C
-	37.0–38.0 °C

Why is maternal pyrexia an important complication during the first stage of labour?
-	Maternal pyrexia may cause maternal exhaustion and oliguria.
-	Maternal pyrexia may cause convulsions.
-	Maternal pyrexia may cause hypertension during labour.
+	Maternal pyrexia may be caused by an infection which could be dangerous to the patient.

What is the normal maternal pulse rate during labour?
-	60–80
+	80–100
-	100–120
-	120–140

What causes a rapid maternal pulse during labour?
-	Fetal distress
-	Hypertension
+	Pyrexia
-	Ketonuria

How often should the blood pressure be monitored in a low-risk patient during the latent phase of labour?
-	Every 15 minutes
-	Every 30 minutes
-	Hourly
+	Two-hourly

Which of the following may cause hypertension during labour?
+	Anxiety
-	Fetal distress
-	Chorioamnionitis
-	Anaemia

Which of the following would be the best management if a patient’s blood pressure was 90/50 mm Hg while she was lying on her back?
+	The patient must change into the lateral position and the blood pressure measurement should be repeated after a further one to two minutes.
-	As maternal hypotension may cause fetal distress, the fetal heart rate must be checked immediately.
-	The patient should be reassured that some patients normally have a low blood pressure and, therefore, there is no need for concern.
-	As blood loss is the most likely cause for hypotension, active resuscitation must be started immediately.

A common clinical sign of shock is:
-	Pyrexia
-	Bradycardia
-	Hypertension
+	A cold and sweaty skin

The definition of oliguria is a urine output of less than:
-	10 ml per hour
+	20 ml per hour
-	50 ml per hour
-	100 ml per hour

Oliguria is an important sign of:
+	Dehydration
-	Pyelonephritis
-	Anxiety
-	Heart failure

Which of the following statements is correct?
-	All patients should receive an intravenous infusion from the time of admission to the labour ward.
-	Oral fluids must be given to all patients until full cervical dilatation is reached.
+	All patients to be delivered vaginally must be encouraged to take oral fluids while in the active phase of labour.
-	A 50 ml ampoule of 50% dextrose should be given intravenously as soon as ketonuria develops during labour.

Infection of the urinary tract may cause:
+	1+ proteinuria
-	2+ proteinuria
-	3+ proteinuria
-	4+ proteinuria

Ketonuria during labour:
-	Is always abnormal and must be treated
-	Is an important sign of fetal distress
+	May be seen in normal patients
-	Is a sign of renal disease

Which of the following is a sign of maternal exhaustion during labour?
-	Bradycardia
-	Proteinuria
+	A dry mouth and oliguria
-	Pallor and hypotension

What may cause maternal exhaustion during labour?
-	Chorioamnionitis
-	Preterm labour
-	Placenta praevia
+	Prolonged labour

How should you treat a patient with maternal exhaustion?
-	Stop the contractions with hexoprenaline (Ipradol).
-	Give oxygen by face mask.
+	Give two litres of Ringer’s lactate with 5% dextrose by intravenous infusion.
-	Deliver the infant by Caesarean section.
