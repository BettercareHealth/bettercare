-	Skin redness and tenderness of the skin over the breast
+	Hair loss
-	Deep vein thrombosis
-	Weight gain

What drug can be used to treat nausea and vomiting that occurs with chemotherapy?
-	Imodium
-	Tamoxifen
-	Codeine
+	Stemetil

Mucositis due to chemotherapy presents with:

-	Wait for 12 hours to assess whether the diarrhoea will improve

An important feature of neutropenic sepsis is:
+	A low white cell count
-	A high white cell count
-	A raised platelet count
-	A raised haemoglobin concentration

Neutropenic sepsis usually presents with:
+	A high temperature
-	A generalised pink rash
-	Abdominal pain and constipation
-	Swelling, redness and pain at the surgery site

The most important treatment of neutropenic sepsis is:
-	A blood transfusion
-	Stop the radiotherapy immediately
+	Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics
-	Paracetamol (Panado)

What is an important side effect of Tamoxifen treatment?
+	Increased risk of blood clots, especially deep vein thrombosis
-	Weight loss
-	Anaemia
-	Diarrhoea

Thickening of the lining of the uterus is a complication of:
-	Aromatase inhibitors
+	Tamoxifen
-	Methotrexate
-	Herceptin

What is a common side effect of aromatase inhibitors?
+	Osteoporosis
-	Bone thickening
-	Headaches
-	Vaginal discharge

Aching bones and muscles in women receiving aromatase inhibitors should be treated with:
-	Estrogen cream locally
-	Oral progesterone
-	Prednisone
+	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Brufen)

Skin changes associated with radiotherapy:
-	Are uncommon and occur as soon as radiotherapy begins
+	Are common and usually occur about 10 days after the treatment starts
-	Usually present with blisters and severe pain
-	Are rare and do not look like the skin changes with breast cancer

Skin changes with radiotherapy can be managed with:
+	Corn starch (Maizena)
-	Talcum powder
-	Short, repeated exposure to sunshine
-	Soaking the arm in cold water

Which symptom is common during radiotherapy?
-	Nausea and vomiting
+	Tiredness
-	Bone pain
-	Sweating

Which wound complication occurs a few weeks after surgery?
-	Lymphoedema
+	Seroma formation
-	Scarring with keloid formation
-	Recurrence of cancer in the wound

Stiffness of the shoulder after surgery:
-	Is only seen after axillary clearance of lymph nodes
-	Is uncommon and is usually treated with rest and pain killers
+	Usually responds well to regular arm exercises
-	Responds well to a course of steroids

Lymphoedema is best prevented by:
+	Diagnosing cancer early so that less surgery is needed
-	Using adjuvant radiotherapy rather than chemotherapy
-	Keeping the arm bandaged after surgery
-	Removing all the axillary lymph nodes

The management of lymphoedema includes:
-	A short course of antibiotics
-	A long course of oral steroids
+	Elevating, exercising and compression bandaging the arm
-	Resting the arm in a sling
