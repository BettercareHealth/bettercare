title: Childhood HIV. Test 3. Management of children with HIV infection


Where should most children with HIV infection be managed?
+	In a community-based primary care clinic
-	In a large regional hospital
-	In a teaching hospital
-	In a specialised paediatric HIV clinic

What is family centred care?
-	The ill child should be visited at home by a nurse rather than taking the child to a clinic.
-	The parents, rather than healthcare workers, should provide medical care. 
-	The care of the family is more important than the care of the child.
+	Children should be seen as a member of the family and not simply as an individual.

All HIV-exposed infants:
-	Do not need special care and follow up.
-	Only need to be seen at six months to assess their HIV status.
+	Should be carefully assessed at six weeks of age.
-	Should be started on antiretroviral treatment.

What immunisations should not be given to a child with symptomatic HIV infection?
+	BCG
-	Influenza vaccine
-	Tetanus vaccine
-	Haemophilus influenza vaccine

Primary prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole reduces the risk of which infection?
-	Tuberculosis
-	HIV
+	Pneumocystis jiroveci
-	Rota virus

When should co-trimoxazole prophylaxis be started in an HIV-exposed infant?
-	At birth
+	At six weeks
-	At nine months
-	At one year

What important side effect may occur when children are given co-trimoxazole prophylaxis?
-	Shortness of breath
-	Jaundice
-	Severe diarrhoea
+	Severe skin rash

Why is good nutrition important in HIV-exposed infants?
-	It prevents them becoming HIV infected.
-	With good nutrition co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is not necessary.
+	It helps to maintain the normal functioning of the immune system.
-	It prevents side effects of antiretroviral drugs.

The nutritional state should be routinely monitored by:
-	Measuring the vitamin A blood concentration every three months.
-	Screening the urine for proteinuria every month.
-	Taking a dietary history at every clinic visit.
+	Measuring and plotting weight on the Road-to-Health card.

Nutrition can be improved by giving the child:
-	Potato chips every day to increase the energy input.
-	Cool drinks as they are rich in vitamin C.
+	Beans, lentils or milk which are high in protein.
-	Chocolate as it is high in fat.

Which vitamin supplement is particularly important for children with HIV infection?
+	Vitamin A
-	Vitamin D
-	Vitamin E
-	Vitamin K

Which mineral supplement reduces the severity of diarrhoea?
-	Iron
-	Copper
+	Zinc
-	Lead

Which drug can be used for regular deworming?
-	Co-trimoxazole
+	Mebendazole
-	Fluconazole
-	Metronidazole

Neurodevelopment should be monitored by:
-	Weighing the child regularly
-	Measuring head circumference regularly
+	Assessing developmental milestones regularly
-	Testing hearing regularly

HIV-infected children over a year of age who are well should be clinically assessed:
-	Every month
-	Every three months
+	Every six months
-	Only if they are unwell

Which test is used to monitor the immune system in HIV-infected children?
-	The white cell count
-	The clinical stage
-	The weight
+	The CD4 percentage or count

What is the immunological indication to start antiretroviral treatment in children below 5 years?
-	CD4 percentage below 10%
-	CD4 percentage below 15%
+	All children below 5 years of age should be started on treatment.
-	Children under 12 months of age are too young for treatment.

Which children are adolescents?
-	All teenagers
-	All children between puberty and 20 years
-	Children between 14 and 19 years
+	Children between 10 and 19 years

In South Africa many adolescents have become infected with HIV:
+	At birth
-	Due to HIV-contaminated needles in hospital
-	During immunisation
-	When donating blood

How can adolescents best protect themselves from becoming infected with HIV?
-	Avoid homosexual contact
+	Delay sexual debut (first intercourse)
-	Use oral contraception
-	Use co-trimoxazole prophylaxis
