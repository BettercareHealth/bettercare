title: Newborn Care. Test 1. Failure to breathe at birth and resuscitation


How many infants breathe well at birth?
-	50%
-	75%
-	80%
+	90%

Which vital sign is included in the Apgar score?
-	Temperature
+	Heart rate
-	Meconium staining
-	Oedema

Most newborn infants that breathe well after delivery should have:
-	Pink hands at birth
-	Pink feet at birth
-	Pink hands and feet by 1 minute
+	A pink tongue by 1 minute

A normal Apgar score at 1 minute is:
-	Above 10
+	7–10
-	3–7
-	Less than 3

The Apgar score at 1 minute should be determined: 
+	In all newborn infants
-	Only when there have been signs of fetal distress
-	Only if the infant does not breathe well after birth
-	Only if the infant needs mask ventilation

What is the value of the 1 minute Apgar score?
-	It predicts brain damage.
-	It confirms fetal hypoxia.
+	It is used to assess the infant’s clinical condition at birth.
-	It is used to assess gestational age.

What is the value of a 5 minute Apgar score?
-	It is used to define ‘failure to breathe at birth’.
+	It is used to assess the success or failure of resuscitation.
-	It helps to decide whether further resuscitation is hopeless.
-	It accurately predicts whether the infant will develop cerebral palsy.

In which of the following situations would you anticipate that the infant will need resuscitation at birth?
+	Caesarean section under general anaesthesia
-	Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia
-	Mother had pethidine 8 hours before delivery
-	Mother received nitrous oxide during the second stage of labour

All the equipment for basic resuscitation is needed:
-	In operating theatres only
-	In level 2 hospitals only
-	In level 3 hospitals only
+	In all hospitals and clinics where infants are delivered

If an infant does not breathe immediately after birth, what do you do first?
+	Stimulate the infant by drying it.
-	Start chest compressions.
-	Cool the infant.
-	Give naloxone by intramuscular injection.

Which staff members need to be able to resuscitate infants:
-	Doctors only
-	Midwives only
-	Doctors and senior midwives only
+	All staff who conduct deliveries

After being well dried which infants should have their mouth and pharynx suctioned:
-	Preterm infants
-	Infants born by Caesarean section
+	Infants that fail to breathe well
-	All newborn infants

Which infants should be resuscitated with oxygen?
+	Infants who fail to respond to good bag and mask ventilation
-	Preterm infants
-	Meconium stained infants
-	All infants

An infant who cannot be adequately ventilated with bag and mask should: 
+	Be intubated and ventilated.
-	Be given chest compressions.
-	Be given adrenaline.
-	Receive no further resuscitation as it has probably suffered brain damage.

Which of the following rates is recommended for ventilating a newborn infant?
-	20 breaths per minute
+	40 breaths per minute
-	80 breaths per minute
-	140 breaths per minute

Naloxone (Narcan) reverses the respiratory depression caused by:
-	Barbiturates
-	General anaesthesia
-	Diazepam (Valium)
+	Pethidine and morphine

The infant’s chance of survival is poor if:
-	The 1 minute Apgar score is low.
-	The 5 minute Apgar score is low.
+	The 20 minute Apgar score is low.
-	The infant needs to be intubated and ventilated.

If an infant is heavily meconium stained at delivery:
-	It is important to stimulate respiration before suctioning the airways.
+	The mouth should be suctioned before the shoulders are delivered.
-	The mouth should only be suctioned after the infant is completely delivered.
-	Only the nose should be suctioned.

Which size of catheter should be used to suction a meconium-stained infant at birth?
-	F 3.5
-	F 5
-	F 6
+	F 10

Severe hypoxia before delivery causing fetal distress:
-	Will always result in stillbirth or neonatal death.
+	May cause transient or permanent brain damage.
-	Does not damage the heart and kidneys.
-	Is an indication not to resuscitate the infant at birth.
