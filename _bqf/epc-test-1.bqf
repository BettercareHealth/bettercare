title: Ebola Prevention and Control. Test 1. Virology and Epidemiology


What is Ebola?
-	A country in Central Africa
+	A common name for Ebola virus disease
-	A form of malaria recently discovered in West Africa
-	A serious disease spread by lice

What do viruses need to survive and multiply?
+	A host cell
-	Red blood cells
-	Blood agar culture medium
-	A culture solution rich in glucose

Viral haemorrhagic fevers include:
-	Malaria
-	Typhoid
-	Rheumatic fever
+	Marburg fever

Congo fever virus can be transmitted to humans by:
-	Mosquitoes
-	Bites by a bat
+	Ticks
-	Lice

Eating bushmeat is an important source of:
+	Ebola
-	Yellow fever
-	Dengue fever
-	Lassa fever

Touching or washing corpses in a traditional ceremony may be responsible for spreading:
-	Rift valley fever
-	Chikungunya fever
+	Ebola
-	Crimean fever

What is the incubation period of Ebola?
-	2 to 5 days
-	2 to 7 days
+	2 to 21 days
-	2 to 40 days

Which body fluids may contain Ebola virus?
-	Blood only
-	Vomitus and diarrhoea stool only
-	Semen and vaginal secretions only
+	All body fluids

Ebola is infectious:
-	Throughout the incubation period
+	When the patient is clinically ill
-	Only when the patient starts to bleed
-	During the 21 days after the patient has clinically recovered

Ebola virus may be transmitted:
+	By contact with a person’s mucous membranes
-	By droplet spread when coughing
-	By direct contact with intact skin
-	Sexually for a year after the illness

Ebola was first described:
-	In ancient Greece
-	In South Africa in 1953
+	In the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976
-	In Sierra Leone in 2004

One of the countries most affected with Ebola during the current outbreak is:
-	Sudan
-	Tanzania
-	Senegal
+	Liberia

Why are there so many infected cases in the current outbreak of Ebola?
-	Because the climate is hot and damp
+	Because of overcrowding in urban areas
-	Because of poor hygiene in rural areas
-	Because of poor mosquito control measures

The risk of a healthcare worker becoming infected with Ebola virus:
-	Is the same as the general population
-	Is low if they wash their hands well after touching a patient with Ebola
+	Is high if they do not use standard precautions correctly
-	Is so high that it is best if the family care for the patient

The most important principle in investigating a case of suspected Ebola is to:
-	Get as many laboratory investigations as possible
+	Only do essential investigations
-	Choose the cheapest investigations
-	Avoid taking a blood sample as the patient may start bleeding severely

What is a bio-safety laboratory?
-	A small mobile laboratory in the tropical forest
-	A fully automated laboratory that does not need laboratory staff
+	A laboratory with maximum safety features
-	A standard hospital laboratory

What laboratory test can be used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of Ebola?
+	ELISA or PCR
-	Standard light microscopy
-	A skin test
-	A full blood count and liver function tests

What laboratory tests are useful to detect other diseases which may be confused with Ebola?
-	Throat swab and viral culture for influenza
-	Serum bilirubin and packed cell volume for yellow fever
+	Malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and smear
-	Blood culture for Marburg fever

How should a laboratory specimen be transported?
-	The information form should be wrapped tightly around the test tube
+	The test tube should be placed in a screw-top container and then another container such as a leak-proof plastic box with a secure lid
-	The test tube should be placed in an open container of ice
-	No special precautions are needed

How can a laboratory specimen be safely processed?
-	It should be centrifuged first to decontaminate it
-	The test tube containing the specimen should be passed through a flame a few times to kill the virus
-	A few drops of chlorine should be added to the specimen as soon as it is opened
+	Full personal protective equipment should be worn when handling the specimen
