title: Primary Newborn Care. Test 1. Care of infants at birth


When should the umbilical cord be clamped in a normal infant?
+	At 2 to 3 minutes after delivery
-	After the infant has been breathing well for 5 minutes
-	Immediately after delivery
-	After the placenta has been delivered

When should the infant be given to the mother?
-	After the mother has had a chance to sleep
+	As soon as possible
-	When the infant has had a bath
-	It does not matter when the infant is given to the mother

Which infants should receive vitamin K (Konakion) after delivery?
-	Only preterm infants
-	Only infants with a low Apgar score
-	Only infants who have had a traumatic or difficult delivery
+	All infants

What should be placed in the eyes of infants after birth?
-	Nothing
-	Sterile water to remove meconium or vernix
+	An antibiotic ointment such as chloromycetin
-	Colostrum

A newborn infant is said to have failed to breathe well at delivery:
-	If the infant does not breathe well immediately after delivery
-	If the infant’s hands and feet are still blue at 1 minute after delivery
-	If the infant has not cried by 5 minutes after delivery
+	If the infant does not breathe well or cry after it has been well dried

Which vital sign is included in the Apgar score?
-	Temperature
+	Heart rate
-	Meconium staining
-	Oedema 

The Apgar score at 1 minute should be determined: 
+	In all newborn infants
-	Only when there have been signs of fetal distress
-	Only if the infant does not breathe well after birth
-	Only if the infant needs mask ventilation

What is the value of the 1 minute Apgar score?
-	It predicts brain damage
-	It confirms fetal hypoxia
+	It is used to document the infant’s clinical condition after birth
-	It is used to assess gestational age

What is the value of the 5 minute Apgar score?
+	It indicates whether the infant is responding to resuscitation
-	If less than 7, it confirms that the infant will die
-	If 7 or more, it confirms that the infant will survive
-	It is used to decide whether cardiac massage is needed

A normal Apgar score at 1 minute is:
-	Above 10
+	7–10
-	3–7
-	Less than 3

What is a common cause of a low Apgar score?
-	Hypothermia
+	Excessive suctioning of the mouth and throat
-	Infection
-	Hyaline membrane disease

Fetal hypoxia is defined as:
-	Failure to breathe after delivery
-	A low 1 minute Apgar score
+	Too little oxygen in the fetus
-	Intra-uterine death

After delivery the following infants should have their mouth and throat suctioned:
-	Preterm infants
-	Infants born by Caesarean section
+	Infants that fail to breathe well after stimulation
-	All newborn infants

Which staff members need to be able to resuscitate infants:
-	Doctors only
-	Midwives only
-	Doctors and senior midwives only
+	All staff who conduct deliveries

What is the most important step in resuscitating an infant?
+	Giving bag-and-mask ventilation
-	Starting cardiac massage
-	Cooling the infant
-	Giving naloxone by intramuscular injection

An infant who still has a slow heart rate after receiving bag-and-mask ventilation should: 
+	Be given chest compressions
-	Be given vitamin K (Konakion)
-	Be given adrenaline
-	Receive no further resuscitation as it has probably suffered brain damage

Naloxone (Narcan) reverses the respiratory depression caused by:
-	Barbiturates
-	General anaesthesia
-	Diazepam (Valium)
+	Pethidine and morphine

If an infant is heavily meconium stained at delivery:
-	It is important to stimulate respiration before suctioning the airways
+	The mouth should be suctioned before the shoulders are delivered
-	The mouth should only be suctioned after the infant is completely delivered
-	Only the nose should be suctioned

Which size of catheter should be used to suction a meconium-stained infant at birth?
-	F 3.5
-	F 5
-	F 6
+	F 10

A stomach washout should be given to:
-	All low-birth-weight infants
-	Infants with a low 1 minute Apgar score
+	Infants covered with thick meconium
-	All meconium-stained infants
