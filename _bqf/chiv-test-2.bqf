title: Childhood HIV. Test 2. Clinical and immunological diagnosis of HIV infection


During the first six weeks after HIV infection:
-	The child always becomes seriously ill.
-	The CD4 count rises.
+	The amount of HIV in the blood increases.
-	The haemoglobin concentration falls.

Acute seroconversion illness usually presents with:
+	A glandular fever-type illness
-	Jaundice
-	Anaemia
-	Vaginal or urethral discharge

How long is the latent phase of HIV infection in children who are infected at birth?
-	10 days
-	6 weeks
+	About three to six months
-	Usually five to 10 years

What is the value of knowing the clinical stage of HIV infection?
+	The clinical stage predicts what the prognosis will be, especially without antiretroviral treatment.
-	It helps to diagnose symptomatic HIV infection at birth.
-	Antiretroviral treatment is not useful in stage 3 and 4 HIV disease.
-	It is of very little clinical help.

When is HIV infection called advanced HIV disease in children?
-	At any stage of symptomatic HIV infection.
+	If the clinical stage is 3 or 4.
-	If the CD4 percentage is below 20.
-	If the viral load is above one million copies/ml.

Which clinical sign is common in stage one HIV infection?
-	Night sweats
-	Fever
+	Persistent generalised lymphadenopathy
-	Weight loss

Which clinical condition is common in stage 2 HIV infection?
+	Skin rash
-	Severe diarrhoea
-	Extrapulmonary tuberculosis
-	Oral candidiasis (thrush)

A common clinical condition in stage 3 HIV infection is:
+	Severe recurrent bacterial pneumonia
-	Pneumocystis pneumonia
-	Enlarged parotid glands
-	Hydrocephaly

What clinical condition indicates that an HIV-positive child has stage 4 disease?
-	Oral candidiasis
+	Oesophageal candidiasis
-	Diarrhoea for less than two weeks
-	Persistent fever

Unexplained severe malnutrition with wasting that does not respond to feeding indicates that the HIV infection has reached what clinical stage?
-	Stage 1
-	Stage 2
-	Stage 3
+	Stage 4

What skin rash is common in children with HIV infection?
-	Acne
-	Urticaria
-	Kaposi’s sarcoma
+	Pruritic papular eruption

What form of cancer is more common in children with HIV infection?
-	Cervical cancer
-	Leukaemia
+	Lymphoma
-	Neuroblastoma

What test is used to screen children older than 18 months for HIV infection?
-	VDRL test
-	PCR test
-	HIV culture
+	Rapid test

How long should you wait after stopping breastfeeding a nine-month-old child before doing an ultrasensitive p24 antigen test to diagnose or exclude HIV infection?
-	72 hours
-	One week
+	Six weeks
-	18 months

Which test can confirm that a six-week-old infant has HIV infection?
+	PCR test
-	Rapid test
-	ELISA test
-	CD4 test

Screening tests for HIV infection usually become positive when the person has been infected for:
-	Six days
+	Six weeks
-	Six months
-	Six years

What is the normal CD4 percentage in children?
-	Below 10%
-	10 to 25%
+	25% or more
-	100%

During the progression of untreated HIV infection the CD4 count:
-	Rises
+	Falls
-	Stays the same
-	Is not important

What is the value of knowing the CD4 percentage?
+	The lower the CD4% the greater the risk of severe illness.
-	The higher the CD4% the greater the risk of death.
-	A low CD4% indicates that the child’s immune system is improving.
-	A normal CD4% indicates that the child does not have HIV infection.

In South Africa, who can give consent for a child to be tested for HIV?
-	The consent of both parents is always needed.
-	The consent of the medical superintendent is always needed.
+	A child of 12 years or older can give consent.
-	Any child attending school can give consent.
