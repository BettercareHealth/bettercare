title: Infection Prevention and Control. Test 5. Infection control considerations for healthcare facility design


The most important consideration when designing a new healthcare facility is: 
-	The budget available for the project
+	The disease profile of the local community
-	The community’s stated service needs
-	The existing facilities available in the area. 

Infection control practitioners should be involved in healthcare facility design because:
+	They can advise on design elements to reduce healthcare-associated infection (HAI)
-	They will have to work in the facility once built
-	They know better than clinicians what is required for a new building
-	They are required by law in all countries to be involved in all building projects.

Infection control practitioners should be involved in healthcare facility design: 
-	Just before the ward is opened to admit new patients
-	Just before the building or renovation work starts
-	After the approved plans have been received from the architect
+	When the ideas for the building or renovation are first being discussed. 

Infection control practitioners should advise on the following aspects: 
-	Resuscitation and clinical equipment needed
-	The colour of the walls and floors
+	Isolation rooms, ventilation, layout and fittings
-	The admission criteria for patients to the new ward/area.

Beds in the general wards should be separated by at least:
+	2.5 metres (centre of bed to centre of next bed)
-	3.0 metres (edge of bed to edge of next bed) 
-	3.5 metres (centre of bed to centre of next bed)
-	2.5 metres (edge of bed to edge of next bed).

In general wards, at least one dedicated handwash basin should be provided:
-	For every bed
-	For every two beds
-	For every four beds
+	For every six beds.

The common route/s for infection transmission in clinics include: 
-	Respiratory 
+	Respiratory and contact
-	Faeco-oral 
-	Inoculation.  

The highest risk of infection in dental clinics is from: 
+	Blood-borne viruses
-	Bacteria
-	Gastro-intestinal viruses
-	Prions.

Isolation rooms: 
-	Should make up at least 30% of all hospital beds
-	Should always be mechanically ventilated under positive pressure
-	Do not need en suite bathrooms
+	Function to separate infectious patients from susceptible patients. 

Operating theatres:
-	Should be mechanically ventilated under negative pressure
-	Should be kept at temperatures between 24 and 28 °C
-	May routinely sterilize their own surgical equipment in the theatre
+	Should have well-demarcated ‘clean’ and ‘sterile’ zones.

Intensive care units (ICU):
-	Do not require isolation rooms as the beds are far apart 
-	Should have a minimum of 2.5 metres space between beds
-	Require at least one handwash basin for every six ICU beds
+	Should regularly train their staff on hand hygiene and aseptic technique. 

Accident and emergency units:
-	Do not require isolation rooms/bays
+	Should have sharps containers within easy reach of every bed/bay
-	Must have negative pressure ventilation
-	Are not high-risk areas for needlestick injuries.

Patients in burns wards: 
-	Are not at particularly high risk of infection
-	Acquire infections mostly by respiratory transmission 
+	Acquire infections by contact with staff, equipment and the environment
-	Should all be placed under protective isolation.

Neonatal wards require:
-	One isolation room for every 30 beds
+	Disease screening protocols for mothers admitted to kangaroo care units
-	Handwash basins next to every cot/incubator
-	Specialised environmental disinfection of all surfaces. 

Milk preparation areas:
+	Are a high-risk area for microbial contamination of infant feeds
-	Can store milk in fridges together with medication and foodstuffs
-	Can prepare feeds up to 48 hours in advance
-	Can use low-level disinfection for babies’ bottles and teats. 

With regard to expressed breastmilk (EBM):
-	The risk of HIV or hepatitis transmission through breastmilk is low
-	Mothers may express, label and store the EBM themselves
+	EBM should be stored at 4–6 °C and used within 24 hours
-	Pasteurisation is not needed for pooled EBM.

Mortuary workers:  
-	Do not require personal protective equipment since corpses do not transmit infections
+	Are at risk of penetrating injuries, mucosal splashes and infection with respiratory pathogens
-	Are not required to change out of their personal clothing before coming on duty  
-	Are not required to shower before coming off duty.

Ambulance staff:
+	Should try to establish any infection transmission hazards before transporting a patient
-	Should wear surgical masks when transporting patients with pulmonary TB
-	Should ask patients with pulmonary TB to wear N95 respirators when inside the ambulance
-	May use alcohol handrub to decontaminate hands covered in blood or mucus.

Hospital kitchens: 
-	Staff require only routine pre-employment health checks
-	Require the same personal protective equipment as the clinical staff
-	May prepare raw and cooked food in the same area
+	Require an uninterrupted supply of hot and cold water. 

Support services staff:
-	Are at lower risk for pathogen exposure than clinical staff
+	Should receive pre-employment hepatitis B immunisation
-	Are not required to wear personal protective equipment
-	Are not required to undergo training in infection prevention and control.
