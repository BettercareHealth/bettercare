title: Newborn Care. Test 11. Oxygen therapy


Metabolism requiring oxygen is called:
-	Oxidation
-	Anaerobic metabolism
-	Anabolic metabolism
+	Aerobic metabolism

Most oxygen is carried in the blood by:
+	The red blood cells
-	The white blood cells
-	The platelets
-	The serum

What is the normal concentration of oxygen in room air?
-	20%
+	21%
-	22%
-	30%

The amount of oxygen carried in the blood can be accurately determined by: 
-	Deciding whether the tongue is pink or cyanosed
-	Measuring the flow of oxygen into the head box
+	Using a pulse oximeter
-	Using an oxygen monitor

What is the abbreviation for the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood?
+	PaO₂
-	SaO₂
-	FiO₂
-	O₂

What is the normal partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood of a healthy newborn infant?
-	6–8 kPa
+	8–10 kPa
-	10–12 kPa
-	12–20 kPa

What is the normal oxygen saturation in the arterial blood of a newborn infant?
-	80–86%
+	86–92%
-	92–95%
-	95–100%

When oxygen is given to infants it is usually blended with:
-	Nitrogen
+	Air
-	Carbon dioxide
-	Hydrogen

Lack of enough oxygen in inspired air may:
-	Damage the airways.
-	Damage the red cells.
+	Damage the brain.
-	None of the above.

Extra oxygen should be given to:
-	All infants at birth
-	All infants under 1500 g
-	All infants with peripheral cyanosis
+	All infants with central cyanosis

What is a safe concentration of inspired oxygen?
-	 0.40 (i.e. 40%)
-	 0.25 (i.e. 25%)
-	 0.10 (i.e. 10%)
+	 Any FiO₂ that gives a normal partial pressure or normal saturation of oxygen in the blood

Excess oxygen in the inspired air may cause:
-	Deafness
+	Blindness
-	Paralysis
-	Mental retardation

Retinopathy of prematurity is usually seen:
-	In underweight for gestational age infants
+	In preterm infants
-	In infants who have been removed from oxygen too soon
-	In infants who have not been given extra oxygen

Retinopathy of prematurity can be largely prevented by:
+	Carefully controlling the PaO₂ or SaO₂
-	Never giving extra oxygen
-	Never giving 100% oxygen
-	Humidifying the oxygen

 100% oxygen may damage the infant and therefore:
-	Should never be given to any infant
-	Should not be given for more than 24 hours
+	Should only be given if a lower concentration of oxygen fails to correct central cyanosis
-	Should never be given to a preterm infant

Oxygen given via an endotracheal tube should be:
-	Cooled and humidified
+	Warmed and humidified
-	Sterilised
-	Warmed only

Extra oxygen is best given into:
+	A head box
-	An incubator
-	A face mask
-	A nasogastric tube

The concentration of oxygen given to an infant is best controlled by:
+	Using a venturi or blender
-	Altering the flow rate
-	Altering the size of the head box
-	Increasing or decreasing the amount of water in the humidifier

To increase the concentration of oxygen that an infant is receiving:
-	Decrease the alarm limit on the oxygen monitor.
-	Increase the alarm limit on the oxygen monitor.
-	Decrease the fraction of oxygen given.
+	Increase the fraction of oxygen given.

The amount of extra oxygen given into a headbox should be measured:
-	As a flow rate (e.g. 5 litres per minute)
-	As a partial pressure (e.g. 5 kPa)
+	As a fraction (e.g. FiO₂ 0.5)
-	As a weight (e.g. 500 g)
