title: Primary Newborn Care. Test 4. Emergency management of infants


The body temperature of a newborn infant should be measured by placing a mercury thermometer:
-	In the mouth
-	In the rectum
+	In the axilla (arm pit)
-	In the incubator

The normal abdominal skin temperature in a newborn infant is:
-	35.5–36.0 °C
+	36.0–36.5 °C
-	36.5–37.0 °C
-	37.0–37.5 °C

Glucose is stored in the body as glycogen in:
-	The brain
-	The red blood cells
+	The liver
-	Fat

Hypoglycaemia is dangerous as it may cause:
-	Jaundice
+	Brain damage
-	Anaemia
-	Bleeding

Which infants are at an increased risk of hypoglycaemia?
-	Infants who are breastfed
-	Female infants
+	Underweight-for-gestational-age infants
-	Jaundiced infants

Hypoglycaemia:
-	Always presents with clinical signs
-	Never presents with clinical signs
+	May present with clinical signs
-	Usually kills the infant

What is the treatment of mild hypoglycaemia?
+	Give a milk feed
-	Start an intravenous infusion
-	Give a single dose of hydrocortisone
-	Give insulin

Severe hypoglycaemia in a preterm infant is best treated by:
-	Feeding the infant with breast milk
-	Giving 5% dextrose by nasogastric tube
-	Giving 50% dextrose by a nasogastric tube
+	Starting an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose

If an infant develops severe hypoglycaemia you should:
-	Repeat the blood glucose measurement in 30 minutes to assess whether it has improved
+	Treat the hypoglycaemia immediately
-	Refer the infant to the nearest newborn intensive care (level 3) unit for treatment
-	Try to contact a more senior staff member to treat the infant

Which one of the following clinical signs is used to diagnose respiratory distress?
-	Pallor
-	Decreased air entry of the chest
+	Recession
-	Pyrexia

Tachypnoea in a newborn is defined as a respiratory rate greater than:
-	20 breaths per minute
-	40 breaths per minute
+	60 breaths per minute
-	80 breaths per minute

What is a common cause of respiratory distress?
-	Starvation
-	Jaundice
+	Wet lung syndrome
-	Meningitis

Hyaline membrane disease is caused by:
+	Too little surfactant
-	Too much surfactant
-	Infection
-	Too much fluid in the lungs

A negative shake test on a sample of gastric aspirate after birth in an infant with respiratory distress suggests a diagnosis of:
-	Wet lung syndrome
-	Pneumonia
-	Pneumothorax
+	Hyaline membrane disease

Hyaline membrane disease is commonly seen in:
-	Meconium-stained infants
+	Preterm infants
-	Underweight-for-gestational-age infants
-	Post-term infants

Hyaline membrane disease can be expected to:
-	Improve steadily after birth
-	Steadily become worse after birth for about 6 hours then improve
+	Steadily become worse after birth for 48 to 72 hours before starting to improve
-	Only start to recover after 1 week

Wet lung syndrome:
+	Improves during the first 2 to 3 days
-	Gradually gets worse after delivery
-	Should be treated with antibiotics
-	Is usually fatal

What is the normal oxygen saturation in the arterial blood of a newborn infant?
-	80–85%
+	86–92%
-	90–95%
-	95–100%

Excess oxygen in the inspired air may cause:
-	Deafness
+	Blindness
-	Paralysis
-	Mental retardation

The amount of oxygen in a headbox can be accurately determined by: 
-	Deciding whether the tongue is pink or cyanosed
-	Measuring the flow of oxygen into the head box
-	Using a saturation monitor
+	Using an oxygen monitor
