-	Bacterial pneumonia
-	Pulmonary tuberculosis
+	Oesophageal candidiasis
-	Viral meningitis

Which of the following is an ‘AIDS-defining infection’?
+	Pneumocystis pneumonia
-	Lymph node tuberculosis
-	Oral moniliasis
-	Severe impetigo

What gastrointestinal problem is common in children with HIV infection?
-	Gastric ulcers
+	Chronic diarrhoea
-	Rectal bleeding
-	Anal fissures

Severe herpes mouth ulcers can be treated with:
-	Penicillin
-	Nystatin
+	Acyclovir
-	AZT

What is a common respiratory condition in children with severe HIV infection?

-	Viral croup
+	Chronic lung disease

Co-trimoxazole is used to treat:
-	Herpes stomatitis
-	Cryptococcal meningitis
+	Pneumocystis pneumonia
-	Cytomegalovirus retinitis

Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) usually presents with:
+	A chronic cough and shortness of breath
-	Haemoptysis (coughing up blood)
-	Chest pain
-	High fever

Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) responds well to:
-	Antibiotics

+	Steroids

How common is tuberculosis in children with HIV infection?
-	Uncommon
-	Common in children who have not had BCG
-	Only common in stage 4
+	Common in all clinical stages

What is the commonest form of tuberculosis in children with HIV infection?
-	Tuberculous meningitis
+	Pulmonary tuberculosis
-	Tuberculosis of the lymph nodes
-	Tuberculous osteitis

Should tuberculosis and HIV be treated at the same time?
-	There are few serious side effects if both tuberculosis treatment and antiretroviral treatment are started at the same time.
-	Control the immune suppression with antiretroviral treatment first before starting to treat the tuberculosis.
+	Start treating the tuberculosis first and then begin antiretroviral treatment two to eight weeks later.
-	Because of drug interactions it is dangerous to treat the two conditions at the same time even if the child is seriously ill.

What side effect is more common if tuberculosis and HIV treatment are given together?
+	Hepatitis
-	Anaemia
-	Respiratory failure
-	Raised intracranial pressure

Which HIV-infected children should receive TB prophylaxis?
-	TB prophylaxis is not effective in children with HIV infection.
-	Children with a chronic cough and weight loss.
+	Children exposed to adults with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis.
-	Children who have not had BCG immunisation.

What is palliative care?
+	Care given to patients with an incurable disease
-	HIV treatment which is taken at home
-	Care given to patients who are dying
-	Care given to the family after a relative has died

Where should terminal care be provided?
-	In hospital
-	In a special HIV clinic
-	In a hospice
+	At home if possible

What are the principles of pain management?
-	Use intramuscular analgesics as they are more effective.
-	Do not use large doses of morphine as it is addictive.
+	Give oral analgesics whenever possible to prevent pain.
-	Only give analgesics eight-hourly because they will suppress respiration if given more frequently.

What analgesic should be used to control moderate pain?
-	Aspirin
+	Codeine phosphate
-	Morphine
-	Pethidine

What side effect is common when morphine is used as an analgesic?
+	Constipation
