title: Breast Care. Test 6. Treatment of breast cancer


What is the aim of breast cancer treatment?
-	To prevent the cancer spreading to the other breast
-	To save the breast at all costs
+	To prolong life and cure the cancer if possible
-	To remove the breast as this will always cure the cancer

What types of local management are available?
+	Surgery
-	Chemotherapy
-	Hormone therapy
-	Targeted therapy

What does neoadjuvant therapy mean?
-	A new form of therapy is used
+	Systemic therapy is given before surgery
-	Radiotherapy is given after chemotherapy
-	Hormone therapy is used on its own

Adjuvant therapy is given:
-	Instead of surgery
-	Before surgery
-	During surgery
+	After surgery

With a wide local excision:
-	Both breasts are removed
-	Radical mastectomy is done
+	The cancer with a margin of normal tissue around it is removed
-	Only the lump is removed

What is a simple mastectomy?
+	All the breast tissue is removed but not the local lymph nodes
-	Both the breast tissue and the local lymph nodes are removed
-	Only the lump and the nipple are removed
-	Only a segment of the breast is removed

When can a breast reconstruction be done?
-	It cannot be done at the same time as the surgery to remove the cancer
+	It can be immediate or delayed
-	It always needs to be delayed so that the skin can be stretched first
-	It should be delayed for 3 months so that the wound can heal first

Important complications of removing the axillary lymph nodes include:
-	Weakness of the arm
+	Swelling of the arm
-	Swelling of the chest
-	Weakness of the hand

What is a sentinel lymph node biopsy?
+	The lymph nodes closest to the breast are removed
-	The lymph nodes furthest from the breast are removed
-	The lymph nodes in the neck are removed
-	All the lymph nodes in the axilla are removed

Chemotherapy is usually given:
-	At the same time as surgery
-	Instead of surgery for stage 1 breast cancer
-	For curative but not palliative care
+	When the cancer has been surgically removed but there is a high risk of recurrence

Who should make the decision whether adjuvant chemotherapy should be given or not?
+	A multidisciplinary team
-	The surgeon alone
-	The radiotherapist alone
-	The oncologist alone

Who should be offered neoadjuvant therapy?
-	Women who need palliative care only
-	Women who have a high risk of cancer in the other breast
+	Women with an inflammatory carcinoma
-	Women with ductal carcinoma in situ

Hormone therapy should be given if:
+	The cancer cells are ER +ve
-	The cancer cells are ER −ve
-	The cancer cells are HER2 +ve
-	The hormonal status of the cells is unknown

Which drug blocks estrogen receptors?
-	Goserelin
+	Tamoxifen
-	Cyclophosphamide
-	Progesterone

Aromatase inhibitors block:
-	Progesterone production from the ovaries
+	Estrogen production from other hormones in postmenopausal women
-	Estrogen receptors on breast cancer cells in premenopausal women
-	Androgen production in the adrenal glands

Hormone therapy should be given:
-	For 6 weeks
-	For 6 months
-	For a year
+	For at least 5 years

What is an example of targeted therapy?
-	Surgery when the lump is identified by ultrasound
-	Choice of the most suitable chemotherapy
+	Treatment with Herceptin
-	Radiotherapy after marking the area on the skin

Adjuvant radiotherapy is usually given after:
-	Six weeks of treatment with Raloxifene
-	Modified radical mastectomy
-	Palliative chemotherapy
+	Wide local excision

Adjuvant radiotherapy is usually given:
+	Six weeks after surgery
-	To pregnant women with breast cancer
-	Before chemotherapy is started
-	If the woman has been treated previously with radiotherapy for a lymphoma

Therapeutic radiotherapy is given:
+	To treat bone pain caused by cancer
-	To prevent local cancer recurrence on the chest wall
-	After axillary clearance to prevent cancer recurrence
-	To shrink a large tumour before surgery
