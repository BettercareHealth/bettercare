How many children have HIV infection in South Africa?

+	About 460 000

When is HIV most commonly spread from mother to child?
-	During pregnancy
+	During labour and vaginal delivery
-	During exclusive breastfeeding
-	While holding, kissing and cuddling the infant

What form of feeding carries the greatest risk of HIV infection for an infant?
-	Exclusive breastfeeding
+	Mixed breastfeeding (breast plus formula milk)
-	Formula feeding alone
-	Feeding choice does not affect the risk of HIV transmission.

Without antiretroviral prophylaxis, what is the overall risk of HIV infection to an infant born vaginally to an HIV-positive woman who decides not to breastfeed her child?
-	5%
-	15%
+	20%
-	35%

How can the risk of HIV transmission to the infant be reduced?
-	Rupture the membranes early to speed up labour.
-	Suction the infantâ€™s mouth well after delivery.
+	Avoid episiotomies unless obstetrically indicated.
-	Avoid elective Caesarean sections.

Prophylactic antiretroviral drugs given to the mother are most effective if:
-	They are used during pregnancy only.
-	They are used during labour only.
+	They are used during pregnancy and labour.
-	They are used after delivery only.

For infants who are exclusively formula-fed, prophylactic antiretroviral drugs can reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission to as low as:
+	5%
-	10%
-	15%
-	20%

Which regimen of antiretroviral prophylaxis is most effective in reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV?
-	Nevirapine alone
+	Nevirapine and AZT
-	3TC alone
-	Lopinavir/ritonavir alone

What factors may increase the risk of HIV transmission in breast milk?
-	Frequent feeding
-	Engorgement
+	Mastitis
-	Feeding expressed breast milk

After counselling, who should choose what feeding method is best for a mother?
-	The doctor
-	The nurse
-	The counsellor
+	The mother

How can healthcare workers reduce their own risk of being infected with HIV?
-	Do not kiss children.
-	Wear gloves when feeding children.
+	Adopt universal precautions.
-	Always resheath needles after use.

What is the correct procedure after a needle-stick injury?
+	Start antiretroviral prophylaxis as soon as possible.
-	Wait for the HIV screening result on the patient before starting antiretroviral prophylaxis.
-	Wait for your own HIV screening result before starting antiretroviral prophylaxis.
-	Antiretroviral prophylaxis is only needed if the needle-stick injury is deep.

Antiretroviral prophylaxis after a needle-stick injury or sexual abuse should be given for:
-	48 hours
-	7 days
-	10 days
