title: Infection Prevention and Control. Test 8. Tuberculosis infection prevention and control


Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is transmitted by:
+	Airborne route
-	Droplet route
-	Contact transmission
-	Blood transmission. 

A recognised risk factor for the development of tuberculosis disease is:
-	Asian race
-	Female sex 
+	Extremes of age (young infants and the elderly)
-	Frequent use of public transportation.

Which of these people has the highest risk for developing tuberculosis disease? 
-	An HIV patient on antiretroviral medications whose CD4 count has normalised
+	A diabetic 80-year-old female on steroids for her debilitating arthritis
-	A 65-year-old hypertensive male with acute heart attack in the ICU
-	A 28-year-old healthcare worker assigned to the TB ward wearing proper protection.

Which of the following TB patients is the most infectious?
-	A well college student found to have suspicious TB infiltrates on a chest X-ray
-	A lady with TB of the spine
-	A boy with TB of the lymph nodes in his neck (draining fluid containing TB bacilli)
+	An elderly man coughing profusely (with a lung cavity from TB) who is not yet on treatment.

The risk of TB transmission is determined by: 
+	The degree and duration of TB exposure
-	Whether the patient had received the BCG immunisation in childhood
-	Whether the index case shared eating utensils with the exposed individuals
-	Whether the index case is a healthcare worker. 

Which of these areas in a hospital are considered high risk for TB transmission? 
-	The cafeteria
-	The pharmacy
-	The operating theatres
+	The adult medical wards.

What is the advantage of the sputum smear microscopy test for TB bacilli: 
+	It is affordable even in resource-limited settings
-	It can detect patients with low levels of TB bacilli (pauci-bacillary disease)
-	It can differentiate easily between various types of mycobacteria
-	It can predict drug resistance.

The term multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) implies:
+	TB which is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin
-	Resistance to all first line anti-TB drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol
-	Resistant to at least four classes of anti-TB drugs
-	Resistance acquired during the course of therapy.

Which statement is true regarding drug-resistant TB (DRTB)? 
-	DRTB is more infectious and communicable than the regular susceptible TB
-	DRTB is treated for the same number of months as the regular susceptible TB
-	DRTB patients convert to sputum smear-negative faster than susceptible TB
+	DRTB is more expensive and difficult to treat than drug susceptible TB.

What are the ‘3Is’ of TB prevention? 
-	TB-IPC; Intensified directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS); Integrated contact tracing 
-	TB-IPC, Isoniazid preventive therapy, Intensive training
+	TB-IPC, Isoniazid preventive therapy, Intensified case finding
-	TB-IPC, Isoniazid preventive therapy, Isolation rooms.

Implementation of TB infection control in a healthcare facility is the responsibility of:
-	TB patients
-	The TB physicians 
-	The hospital security workers
+	All healthcare workers.

Which of these strategies is the most important in the hierarchy of TB infection control? 
-	Leadership control
+	Administrative controls
-	Environmental controls
-	Respiratory controls.

Environmental controls for TB: 
-	Should provide healthcare workers with protective equipment
+	Should remove, replace, dilute or clean contaminated air  
-	Should effectively treat patients with TB with correct anti-TB medications
-	Should provide clean and safe environments for patients with TB.

Which type of ventilation is preferred in low-resource settings? 
+	Natural ventilation
-	Mechanical ventilation
-	Mixed ventilation methods
-	Positive pressure ventilation.

Natural ventilation: 
-	Involves use of air-handling units to direct the movement of air in a room
-	Involves use of air-conditioners to recycle air in rooms 
-	Involves supply and removal of air by electricity-dependent negative pressure systems
+	Involves natural draughts of fresh air from the outside environment. 

N95 respirators: 
+	Have high filtering efficiency, preventing inhalation of over 95% of particulate aerosols
-	Should be worn only when within 1 metre of a TB suspect or confirmed case
-	Can filter out particles from 100–1000 microns in size 
-	Should be worn by both patients and healthcare workers.

N95 respirators: 
-	Can be safely re-used over and over again up to one month
-	Should be worn by patients to reduce TB bacilli in the environment
+	Should be stored in dry envelopes marked with the healthcare worker’s name
-	Can still be used even if torn, as long as a fit test has been done.

When should patients with infectious TB be required to wear a surgical mask? 
+	When TB patients are in a closed or poorly ventilated area with other persons
-	When TB patients are in their own single rooms for long periods of time
-	When TB patients are allowed to go outdoors 
-	When TB patients are sent home from the hospital.

Healthcare workers in high-burden TB settings are: 
-	At low risk of acquiring TB
-	At the same risk of acquiring TB as the general population
-	Protected from acquiring TB by the BCG vaccine
+	At significantly increased risk of acquiring TB from ongoing TB exposure.

Patients newly diagnosed with TB should be advised that: 
-	They must wear a surgical mask or face-cover outdoors
-	They may sleep in the same room with young infants
+	They should discard all tissues into a plastic bag and wash hands regularly
-	They can stop all preventive measures after two weeks of treatment for drug-resistant TB.
