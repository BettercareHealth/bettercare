What is the definition of hypertension in pregnancy?
-	A diastolic blood pressure of 80&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg or above and/or a systolic blood pressure of 120&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg or above.
+	A diastolic blood pressure of 90&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg or above and/or a systolic blood pressure of 140&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg or above.
-	A diastolic blood pressure of 100&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg or above and/or a systolic blood pressure of 160&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg or above.
-	A rise in diastolic blood pressure of 10&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg.

What is the definition of significant proteinuria in pregnancy?
-	A trace of protein.
+	1+ protein or more.
-	2+ protein or more.
-	3+ protein.

How should you define pre-eclampsia?
-	Hypertension and proteinuria present before the start of pregnancy.
-	Hypertension and proteinuria presenting in the first half of pregnancy.
+	Hypertension and proteinuria presenting in the second half of pregnancy.
-	Hypertension and proteinuria presenting any time in pregnancy.

What is the correct definition of chronic hypertension?
+	Hypertension, without proteinuria, that is present in the first half of pregnancy.
-	Hypertension together with proteinuria, that is present in the first half of pregnancy.
-	Hypertension that is present in the first half of pregnancy plus proteinuria that presents in the second half of pregnancy.
-	Hypertension alone, which is present at the time of booking at 28 weeks.

How common is pre-eclampsia?
-	Most pregnant women develop pre-eclampsia.
-	About 25% of all pregnant women develop pre-eclampsia.
+	About 5–6% of all pregnant women develop pre-eclampsia.
-	Very rare.

Which fetal condition is common in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia?
-	Congenital malformations.
-	Heart failure due to hypertension.
-	Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn.
+	Intra-uterine growth restriction.

Pre-eclampsia may cause fetal distress because it results in:
+	Decrease in placental blood flow.
-	Fetal hypertension.
-	Severe protein loss in the mother’s urine.
-	Congenital abnormalities caused by antihypertensive drugs.

A patient with pre-eclampsia who develops a diastolic blood pressure of 105&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg and 2+ proteinuria at 36 weeks of pregnancy should be graded as having:
+	Pre-eclampsia.
-	Severe pre-eclampsia.
-	Imminent eclampsia.
-	Eclampsia.

What is an important sign of imminent eclampsia?
-	3 + proteinuria.
+	Increased tendon reflexes.
-	A diastolic blood pressure of 110&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg or more.
-	Tenderness on palpating the calves.

A patient with pre-eclampsia has a diastolic blood pressure of 95&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg and 1+ proteinuria. She complains of flashes of light in front of her eyes and upper abdominal pain. In which of the following grades of pre-eclampsia should you put this patient?
-	Pre-eclampsia.
-	Severe pre-eclampsia.
+	Imminent eclampsia.
-	Eclampsia.

Which of the following women has the highest risk of pre-eclampsia?
+	A patient with a history of pre-eclampsia starting early in the third trimester of a previous pregnancy.
-	A patient with a history of a preterm delivery in her previous pregnancy.
-	Grande multiparas.
-	A patient who previously had a twin pregnancy.

Which one of the following may be an early warning sign of pre-eclampsia?
-	Weight loss during the last months of pregnancy.
+	Generalised oedema especially of the face.
-	Oedema of the feet at the end of the day.
-	Pain on passing urine.

What is the management of a patient with pre-eclampsia?
-	Oral antihypertensive drugs.
-	Diuretics to reduce oedema.
+	Hospitalisation.
-	A loading dose of magnesium sulphate.

What is an important complication of pre-eclampsia?
-	Placenta praevia.
-	Oedema of the face.
-	Glycosuria.
+	Intracerebral haemorrhage.

What is management of a patient with severe pre-eclampsia?
-	Prevent eclampsia by giving magnesium sulphate.
-	Prevent intracerebral haemorrhage by decreasing the blood pressure.
-	Transfer the patient to hospital.
+	All of the above.

What drug is used to manage a diastolic blood pressure of 110&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg or more or a systolic blood pressure of 160&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg or more?
-	Alpha methyldopa (Aldomet).
+	Nifedipine (Adalat).
-	Diazepam (Valium).
-	Propranolol (Inderal)

What is the first step in the management of a patient with eclampsia?
-	Give intramuscular phenobarbitone to stop the convulsions.
-	Give dihydralazine (Nepresol) to lower the blood pressure.
+	Turn the patient on her side and ensure an open airway.
-	Insert a Foley’s catheter.

What drug is used to prevent and manage eclampsia?
+	Magnesium sulphate.
-	Magnesium trisilicate.
-	Alpha methyldopa (Aldomet).
-	Diazepam (Valium).

How should a patient, who feels well but has a diastolic blood pressure of 90&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg at 36 weeks gestation, be managed? At all her previous antenatal visits the blood pressure was normal and she has no proteinuria.
-	She must be given an intramuscular injection of dihydralazine (Nepresol).
-	She must be hospitalised.
+	Weekly antenatal visits should be arranged with additional visits to measure the blood pressure and check for proteinuria.
-	A full blood count should be done to exclude a low platelet count.

A rise in blood pressure or the development of proteinuria in a patient with chronic hypertension:
-	Could be a result of the pregnancy and should not be of any concern.
+	Requires urgent referral to hospital.
-	Requires an increase in her daily dose of alpha methyldopa (Aldomet).
-	Requires the addition of a beta blocker or ACE inhibitor.
