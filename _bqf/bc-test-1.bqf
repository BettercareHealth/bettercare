title: Breast Care. Test 1. The normal breast


What is the breast line?
+	A line from the armpit to the groin where breasts can develop
-	A blue line which is commonly seen around the areola in young girls
-	A line between the two nipples which indicates where to apply heart massage in infants who do not breathe by themselves after delivery
-	A line to assess whether breasts are drooping in older women

What are breasts like in most normal infants at birth?
-	Usually the breasts are very small and any breast development is abnormal
-	The breasts cannot develop as newborn infants do not produce sex hormones
-	Only female infants may develop swollen breasts after birth
+	A small lump (a breast bud) can usually be felt under the nipple

During puberty:
-	The rate of breast development is always the same in both breasts so that both breasts are the same size
+	One breast larger than the other (asymmetrical breasts) is common
-	The right breast always starts to develop first
-	One breast larger than the other (asymmetrical breast development) is abnormal

The nipple-areola complex (NAC):
+	Is normal and consists of the nipple and surrounding areola
-	Is a common emotional problem in adolescent girls
-	Is a form of eczema which needs treatment
-	Is an early sign of breast malignancy

What is the function of the lobes in the breast?
-	They produce estrogen
+	They produce milk
-	They determine the size and shape of the breast during puberty
-	They attach the breast to the chest wall

The size of the breasts in a woman who is not breastfeeding is mostly dependent on:
-	The size of the muscles under the breasts
-	The size of the lobes
-	The number of the lobes
+	The amount of supportive and fatty tissue

Where do most breast lymphaticâ€™s drain to?
-	The neck
-	The abdomen
+	The armpit (axilla)
-	The chest

During the menstrual cycle:
+	If a woman has normal lumpy breasts these lumps increase in size before the start of the period
-	The lumps get bigger during the period
-	The lumps get bigger during the week after the period
-	The size of the lumps do not change with the menstrual cycle

What breast changes occur during pregnancy?
-	There are very few changes in women who have small breasts
+	Breast tenderness is common early in pregnancy
-	Colostrum is only produced after delivery
-	Breast changes occur earlier if the fetus is female

How do breasts change in older women?
-	They become smaller because the ducts disappear
-	They become harder as fatty tissue is lost
+	They become softer with an increase in fatty tissue
-	They only change and hang down more if the woman had breastfed her infants

What are aberrations of normal development and involution (ANDI)?
-	Early signs of breast cancer
+	Common variations of normal which may result in the formation of lumps
-	Common problems seen during childhood
-	They are not common and of no clinical importance

What breast changes are common in women between 15 and 25 years of age?

-	Bleeding from one or both nipples
+	Fibroadenomas
-	Duct ectasia

What is a sign of a fibroadenoma?

+	Painless breast lump
-	Nipple discharge

-	A watery nipple discharge
-	Nipple inversion
-	Redness of the overlying skin
+	A palpable smooth mass
