title: Breast Care. Test 5. Cancer of the breast


Where does breast cancer usually start?
-	In the lobes
+	In the ducts
-	In the connective tissue
-	In the fat

Carcinoma in situ means:
+	The cancer cells are not invasive yet
-	The cancer has not spread out of the breast
-	The cancer has not spread to the other breast
-	The cancer has not spread beyond the lymph nodes

Which breast condition is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer?
-	Breast abscess
-	Pregnancy
+	Atypical ductal hyperplasia
-	Breast trauma

How often is the cause of breast cancer unknown?
-	Less than 10% 
-	30%
-	60%
+	90%

How is breast cancer spread?
-	Directly through the chest wall
-	Only via the lymphatics
-	Only via the blood stream
+	By both the lymphatics and blood stream

What factor determines whether a breast cancer is likely to spread or not?
-	The size of the cells
-	The shape of the cells
+	The stickiness of the cells
-	The age of the cells

Do all breast cancers behave in the same way?
-	Yes, as they all grow fast
-	Only in young women when they all grow slowly
-	Only in postmenopausal women when they all grow fast
+	No, as some breast cancers grow fast and others slowly

What does prognosis mean?
-	The age when the cancer presents
+	The probable outcome of the disease
-	When successful treatment can be stopped
-	The time when treatment starts

The grade of a breast cancer indicates:
+	The risk of it spreading
-	The size of the tumour
-	The type of tumour
-	Whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or not

What does the stage of the breast cancer mean:
-	Whether one or both breasts are involved
-	Where in the breast the cancer is found
+	How far it has spread
-	The type of cells seen on cytology

Estrogen receptors on breast cancer cells:
-	Are only found in women and not men
+	Suggest that the cancer will not spread rapidly
-	Suggest that the cancer is very aggressive
-	Indicates that the cancer has spread from another part of the body

The commonest type of breast cancer is:
-	Inflammatory
-	Tubular
+	Ductal
-	Papillary

Lobular cancer is:
+	Usually low grade
-	Usually widely spread at the time of diagnosis
-	Easy to diagnose
-	Rare

Breast cancer usually presents with:
-	A painful breast lump
+	A breast lump that is not painful
-	A large, swollen breast
-	A milky discharge from the nipple

What is an important clinical sign of breast cancer?
-	Bruising of the breast
-	Pus from the nipple
+	Peau d’orange skin change
-	Breast tenderness

What does a breast cancer look like on a mammogram?
-	A black area
-	Many small grey patches
-	Usually a large red area with both black and white patches
+	A white area

When is a mammogram not reliable in diagnosing breast cancer?
-	In older women with fatty breasts
+	In young women with dense breasts
-	In women who have had a breast reduction
-	It is always very reliable

What does a breast cancer look like on ultrasound?
+	A black area
-	A white area
-	A grey area in women of childbearing age
-	Ultrasound is of little value in diagnosing breast cancer

To which organ does breast cancer usually spread?
-	The bone marrow
-	Lymph nodes in the abdomen
+	Lungs
-	Spleen

Which investigation should be done in most women with breast cancer?
-	An X-ray of the long bones in the limbs
-	A MRI scan of the other breast
-	A CT scan of the brain
+	An ultrasound of the liver
