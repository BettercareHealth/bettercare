About the book

This book is part of the Bettercare series which addresses the need for continuing education and learning opportunities for health professionals. The book is produced under the auspices of the Infection Control Africa Network (ICAN), to assist with training of healthcare workers in the current Ebola virus disease outbreak. However the infection control principles discussed in the book are applicable to management of other viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks. The book should be used both by healthcare workers, institutions and Ministries of Health currently dealing with the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The book should also be of value to institutions wanting to increase their level of Ebola-preparedness. 

Funding for the development of this book was generously provided by the Stellenbosch University Rural Medical Education Partnership Initiative (SURMEPI) project. SURMEPI is funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR) through HRSA under the term T84HA21652. We gratefully acknowledge the input of many colleagues worldwide who have been directly or indirectly involved with the West African Ebola outbreak, who helped to ensure the book’s contents were factual and useful in the current Ebola outbreak context.  All royalties from the sale of this book will be donated to the Infection Control Africa Network (ICAN).

STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF VIRUSES

1-1 What is Ebola?

Ebola is the common name used for Ebola virus disease (EVD).  Ebola is a severe clinical illness caused by the Ebola virus.

Ebola is the common name for Ebola virus disease

1-2 What are viruses?
Viruses (a type of micro-organism) are very small and not visible to the naked eye; they are so small that they are even invisible through a light microscope. Viruses can only survive within the cells of another living organism such as a human, animal or plant (the host). Once a virus has entered the host they attach to and enter certain cell types. They then “force” the host cell to make more copies of the virus while remaining protected from the host’s defence mechanisms (the immune response). The intracellular location of viruses and the fact that they “hijack” many cellular functions, makes it difficult for drugs to kill the virus without also causing damage to the host cell. Viruses that are harmful to humans are known as viral pathogens. To cause disease, these pathogenic viruses must first be passed on (transmitted) to a person and then overcome the body’s defence systems. 





1-3 Can viruses be classified into different types?

Viruses are much smaller than other micro-organisms such as bacteria, and can only be seen using a specialised electron microscope, which enlarges the image up to 10 million times. Viruses are grouped by their genetic make-up and their shape.

Note: Viruses are classified by their genetic make-up (single- or double-stranded, RNA or DNA) and their shape (icosahedral, helical or complex). Virus particles (known as virions) have at least two parts: the nucleic acid (genetic material/genome) and the protein capsid (outer shell). Some viruses have a third component, called the virus envelope (or outer membrane). The virus envelope is composed of viral lipids and proteins and is easily damaged by disinfectants and detergents. Other viruses are “naked” or non-enveloped, making them more difficult to destroy or remove by disinfection.

1-4 What do viruses need to survive and multiply?

Viruses use the host cells to provide everything they need for survival, replication (multiplication) and spread. Once inside the host cell, viruses force the cell to make many copies of themselves, then cause the cell to release these viruses to infect neighbouring cells or to be shed (e.g. in the saliva or respiratory tract) to infect other individuals.

VIRAL HAEMORRHAGIC FEVERS
_______________________________________________________________________

1-5 What are viral haemorrhagic fevers?

Viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of diseases affecting both animals and humans. The typical clinical features of VHFs are fever, shock (with or without bleeding) and a high death rate. There are a number of different types of virus which cause VHFs, including:

Ebola virus (Ebola virus disease)
Marburg virus (Marburg fever)
Lassa virus (Lassa fever)
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (Congo fever)
Rift valley fever virus(Rift valley fever)
Yellow fever virus (Yellow fever)
Dengue fever virus (Dengue fever)

Each virus has preferred animal hosts such as bats (Ebola and Marburg virus), rats (Lassa virus) and many wild or domestic animals (Congo virus). Some viruses are spread by arthropods (an insect or tick vector e.g. yellow fever and dengue viruses: mosquitoes; Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus: ticks). Each virus occurs in a particular part of the world where their natural host and/or insect vector occurs.

Note: Five different families of enveloped RNA viruses cause VHF: Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Rhabdoviridae. Within each family, there are different species (subtypes) of viruses e.g. Filoviridae include both Ebola and Marburg virus. Each VHF virus circulates naturally within a preferred animal host. In some cases (known as arthropod-borne viruses), transmission to humans occurs after the bite of an infected insect (vector). [See table at the end of the chapter]






1-6 How do humans become infected with viral haemorrhagic fevers?
VHF can be transmitted from animals or arthropods (insects and ticks) to humans and cause disease through:
Hunting, killing or eating infected wild animals (bushmeat) (Ebola and Marburg fever)
Being in contact with infected rodents’ urine, faeces or saliva (Lassa fever)
Being bitten by an infected mosquito (Yellow fever and Dengue fever)
Being bitten by an infected tick or when crushing infected ticks (Congo fever)
Slaughtering infected livestock or eating raw meat (Rift Valley Fever)
VHF can be transmitted from human to human when:
In contact with a VHF diseased or deceased person’s blood or body fluids
During traditional burial rites involving washing and touching of an infected corpse by family and community members
In healthcare settings, through indirect contact with virus-contaminated objects, surfaces or medical equipment (especially Ebola, Congo fever, Lassa fever).



1-7 What is the incubation period for viral haemorrhagic fevers?

The incubation period of an infectious disease is the typical time interval between becoming infected and developing the first symptoms or signs of the disease. Each virus has a different incubation period:
Ebola virus disease 2 to 21 days (on average about one week)
Marburg fever 3 to 9 days
Lassa fever 6 to 21 days
Congo fever 1 to 12 days

Unlike other viruses (e.g. influenza), people infected with VHF viruses are not infectious during the incubation period. Knowing the maximum length of a particular virus’ incubation period is helpful in deciding if an exposed person is still at risk of developing disease (i.e. a potential case).





1-8 Which body fluids are infectious in Ebola?

All bodily fluids of a person who is ill with Ebola can potentially transmit infection including: blood, urine, vomitus, faeces, saliva, breast milk and semen. To transmit infection, these infected fluids must come into contact with another person’s mucous membranes (eyes, mouth), non-intact skin (open sore) or through an accidental cut or a needle stick injury. Contact may be direct contact with body fluid or indirect via a contaminated object.

It is important to note that although other body fluids are not-infectious after an Ebola patient has recovered, semen may remain infectious for up to 7 weeks. For this reason, Ebola survivors should be advised to use condoms for the duration of this period.





EPIDEMIOLOGY OF EBOLA
_______________________________________________________________

1-9 Where have Ebola outbreaks occurred historically?

Ebola was first documented in 1976 and was named after a river close to the rural village where the index (original) case was described in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Note: Ebola was first identified in Yambuku, a village in the northern Democratic Republic of Congo (then Zaire). Simultaneously an outbreak of Ebola occurred in Nzara, southern Sudan. These two outbreaks consisted of 284 cases with a 88% fatality in Zaire and 318 cases with a 53% fatality in Sudan. Subsequent to these large outbreaks this “new” Filovirus (Ebola virus) was described and further intermittent but “small” outbreaks (usually less than 100 cases) were documented mostly in Central and West Africa (Sudan, Gabon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Congo). To date five strains of Ebola virus have been described including: Sudan, Zaire, Tai Forest, Reston and Bundibugyo ebola virus.  The current outbreak is caused by the Zaire strain.

1-10 When and where did the current Ebola outbreak start?

The current Ebola outbreak began in Guinea in west Africa in late 2013.

Note: The outbreak began in Guéckédou, Guinea, in December 2013 but was only officially confirmed in March 2014 when the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health of Guinea reported 86 suspected cases and 59 deaths from four districts. At the same time suspected cases were being reported from the neighbouring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone. The Zaire Ebolavirus strain was confirmed as the causative agent. In the following months Ebola was confirmed in all three countries, with rapid, wide-scale and ongoing transmission of disease. The outbreak was officially declared as a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” by the WHO in August 2014.

1-11 Which countries have been affected by the current Ebola outbreak?

Almost all cases of Ebola have occurred in three west African countries - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  However a few cases have occurred in neighbouring countries such as Nigeria, Mali and Senegal or in distant countries where sufferers have come into contact with infected people from west Africa (such as the USA and in Europe).

By November 2014 more than 5000 Ebola deaths had been recorded. However many experts believe these figures are underestimates because many Ebola victims die and are buried without confirmation of the diagnosis.

Most cases of Ebola have occurred in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in west Africa

Note: West Africans continue to suffer the greatest burden of Ebola infections and deaths, however many other countries have experienced smaller-scale outbreaks or have hospitalised Ebola patients that were medically-evacuated from outbreak areas. In many cases, secondary transmission (“imported” outbreaks) of Ebola occurred, with transmission particularly to healthcare workers. Countries affected by the current West African outbreak and the number of recorded cases and deaths to date (9 November 2014) is listed below. An unrelated outbreak of EVD, first reported in August 2014 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been terminated.

1-12 What is different about the current Ebola outbreak?

The current Ebola outbreak is the largest in history. It is also different as it started in West Africa whereas Ebola historically affected countries in Central Africa. Infections in this outbreak spread rapidly in part due to the location of the index cases in highly populated, urban areas, whereas historically Ebola outbreaks have occurred in remote, sparsely-populated regions. In addition, the three main affected countries have very limited healthcare infrastructure and human resources (partly due to civil war), which has aggravated the ability of local ministries of health to appropriately respond to the outbreak.

1-13 What are the characteristics of people affected by the current outbreak?
A recently published WHO Ebola epidemiology report (with data from the three worst affected countries and Nigeria), suggests that the disease has affected equal numbers of men and women. People between the ages of 15 and 45 are most affected, with relatively fewer cases among young children and adults over 60. The overall case-fatality rate was 70.8% which is higher than the average mortality reported in previous Ebola outbreaks.
Note: The number of new infections for each Ebola case (the reproductive-number estimates) is around 2, suggesting that the case numbers and deaths will continue to rise without more efforts to prevent ongoing transmission. Some experts (using mathematical models) have estimated that numbers of Ebola cases could double every 20 days, if transmission continues at current levels.
1-14 Are healthcare workers at risk of being infected by Ebola during patient care?

Healthcare workers are at particularly high risk of acquiring Ebola during patient care, especially if the diagnosis of Ebola has not been considered and standard infection control precautions are not being followed. The WHO estimates that around 600 healthcare workers have been infected to date, with 320 dying from Ebola. The risk of acquiring Ebola as a healthcare worker in the West African outbreak is thought to be over 100 times higher than that of the general population in the affected areas.




LABORATORY MANAGEMENT 
_____________________________________________________________

1-15 What is needed for laboratory confirmation of viral haemorrhagic fevers?
It can be difficult to distinguish the clinical symptoms and signs of VHFs from each other and from other diseases, so laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is very important. However, many African countries lack specialist virology laboratories, so diagnostic specimens may have to be transported to the nearest regional reference laboratory. It is important to remember that even in the presence of an Ebola virus infection, laboratory tests performed soon after infection may be falsely negative. If infection is strongly suspected, laboratory tests for VHF should be repeated.
Transporting and processing these specimens poses a serious biohazard risk and for this reason all specimen testing should take place by trained technicians under maximum biological containment conditions (so-called bio-safety level 4 laboratories). In the current Ebola outbreak, several “field” laboratories have been set up in the three worst affected countries to avoid the need to transport specimens internationally and to reduce the diagnostic delay.
Note: Diagnostic tests may vary depending on the specific VHF virus concerned, but may include:
RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay)
ELISA (antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
Antigen-capture detection tests
Serum neutralization test
Electron microscopy
Occasionally virus isolation by cell culture.



1-16 Which other laboratory specimens should be obtained?

The aim of laboratory investigations in cases of VHF should be to provide the best patient care, while at the same time minimizing the risk of health care worker exposure. The number of additional investigations done will depend on the patient’s condition and the level of care and resources available in any particular setting. The overriding principle should be to perform only those invasive procedures and laboratory or special investigations that are absolutely essential. In settings with very limited resources, a baseline VHF diagnostic test and a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) would be required. 
Note: In settings with better resources the following tests would be among those indicated: a VHF confirmatory test; malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and smear; full blood count; liver function test; serum electrolytes, urea and creatinine; clotting profile and blood culture. Laboratory findings that increase the chances of a VHF include: leucopenia (low white cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), anaemia, abnormal blood clotting tests and raised liver enymes (transaminases). However many diseases may result in similar findings, and so specific laboratory confirmation of VHF is always needed.
Only perform invasive procedures and investigations that are absolutely essential

1-17 How should laboratory specimens be transported?

The following instructions should be adhered to when preparing specimens for transport to an off-site laboratory:
In general, the blood specimen should be packed in 3 “layers” of containers (see picture below): the primary container is the test tube that contains the blood specimen; the secondary container could be a screw cap metal or plastic container, or if not available, sealed in multiple plastic ziplock bags to render it leak proof; and the tertiary container (the main shipping container) should be a strong, leak-proof box (polystyrene or plastic) with a handle. 
Each specimen tube must be packed separately in a sealed plastic envelope ziplock bag (so that samples can be distributed to different sections of the laboratory without needing to touch the tubes)
The specimen container tube must have the patient’s identifying details written on it
Sufficient absorbent material should be wrapped around the specimens (to absorb the entire contents in case of leakage)
The specimen request form must be submitted in a separate bag with careful handling to avoid contaminating the request form (with blood or bodily fluid transfer from gloves).
The shipping box should be labelled as bio-hazardous, with a warning that it must not be opened except in the specified laboratory by the specified person. If the transport time to the laboratory is expected to be more than one hour, the specimens must be placed in a cold box with cold packs
When preparing the containers for shipping the following disinfection steps must be applied: the outside of the primary container (test tube) must be profusely sprayed with disinfectant, placed into a secondary container which is then profusely sprayed with disinfectant, and then placed in the main transport/shipping box.

1-18 How can laboratory specimens be processed safely?

In all three of the worst-affected countries, specialised laboratories (with international virology teams) have been established to ensure blood specimens can be rapidly tested for Ebola. Specific recommendations for laboratory processing of potential VHF specimens is beyond the scope of this book, but basic principles would include:

Using only experienced and VHF trained virology personnel
Processing of all samples with extreme caution (inside specialised safety cabinets)
Wearing of full personal protective equipment (PPE) with caution when removing PPE to avoid contact between contaminated items and the skin/mucous membranes
Safe discarding of all used disposable PPE immediately and immediate disinfection of re-usable items
Meticulous attention to hand hygiene 
Thorough disinfection of the external surfaces of specimen containers and work surfaces (with an effective disinfectant e.g. 70% alcohol or solutions containing chlorine at 5000 parts per million / 0.5% solution). 


OUTBREAK INVESTIGATION AND FIELD EPIDEMIOLOGY
_____________________________________________________________

1-19	Why should outbreaks be investigated?

Usually more than three cases of an infectious disease occurring within a short period of time or with evidence of exposure to a common source is considered an outbreak. In the case of Ebola or other viral haemorrhagic fever, even one case (where none were known before) would be considered an outbreak. The presence of an outbreak has to be established using surveillance. Remember that patients in the Ebola countries also may have malaria (20% co-infected), hepatitis or other viral haemorrhagic fever, therefore a cluster of Ebola from similar strains is needed to confirm the outbreak. The number of cases, their contacts and the potential for Ebola to spread further has to be evaluated and documented. Finally surveillance will determine whether control measures are working or not.

1-20	What are the objectives of outbreak investigation?

The objectives are:
•	Active case finding in the community
•	Coordination of transportation of live and dead persons
•	Education and provision of information to affected communities
•	Epidemiological analysis and mapping to guide direction of resources
•	Provision of information from the outbreak areas
•	To support healthcare workers
•	To establish when the epidemic can be declared over using post-outbreak surveillance (42 days after the last case).

1-21 What is field epidemiology?

Field investigation is carried out by mobile surveillance teams who, with the assistance of the community, will conduct active case finding, contact tracing and follow-up. Some practices in remote areas are not identified by ordinary surveillance because the right questions are not asked. This requires trust and involvement of the community networks, which will be actively involved in field surveillance and alert health authorities. The mobile teams have to be quite large and therefore it is worthwhile training and working with local community leaders and the youth to be part of the mobilisation team - it also builds capacity.

1-22 What is a line list?

A line list is usually a single page which has all the relevant information about the demographics, risk factors and contacts. It can either be loaded up onto a tablet or used as a hard copy to collect relevant information. It also helps with carrying out a rapid analysis of the situation and allows early intervention and modification of practice (see appendix A). Because there is a lot of information to collect during an outbreak, it is best to collect a minimum dataset containing unique identifiers which will give the most information. This information can be entered in an electronic database using Excel or Access which is simple and easy. Further analysis can be done at a later stage.

A line list is a single page containing all the important information about the outbreak

1-23 Which technologies can assist with outbreak investigation and contact tracing?

An interesting concept from Medecins san Frontieres (MSF) has been to set up a “rumour registry” and to follow up information given by word of mouth from the community. Electronic tablets can be used by the data collectors and which can be easily downloaded onto the database, either locally or remotely. Another important service to establish (but dependant on the cooperation of service providers) is text messaging systems to a single phone number or hotline which can be followed up quickly and efficiently. The information required here has to be concise such as the exact name and location of the person. The information can be passed onto the contact tracing team.

CASE STUDY 
______________________________________________________

A 35-year old man from an Ebola-affected region in Sierra Leone travels to visit family members in Cote d’Ivoire. Three days ago he attended the funeral of his cousin (who had confirmed Ebola), where he participated in the traditional burial practice of washing the deceased person’s body. At the airport he completes a travel history questionnaire, reporting that he is currently well.

1. Does this man pose a threat for Ebola transmission in Cote d’Ivoire?
 
Yes, he comes from a country with widespread Ebola transmission and has had direct contact with an Ebola-infected corpse.

2. What is the incubation period for Ebola?

The incubation period can be anywhere from 2 to 21 days, but on average is about one week.

3. If this man has been infected with Ebola virus, is he infectious to others at present?

No, even if he has been infected and is in the incubation period, he does not have any symptoms yet and is therefore not infectious to others.

4. The border control decide to quarantine this man and test him for Ebola. What specimens should they take, if any?

Even in the presence of an Ebola infection, laboratory tests performed during the incubation period (i.e. before signs and symptoms begin) may be negative. In this particular case, it may be best for the border control to restrict this man’s travel and to monitor him closely for fever and other symptoms of Ebola. If he remains well for 21 days after his last contact with an Ebola-infected person, he could be declared Ebola-free. If he develops signs and symptoms compatible with Ebola he should be tested. If the first test is Ebola negative but symptoms persist, he should be re-tested in a few days and regarded as potentially infectious until proven negative.

Patient management

Objectives 

When you have completed this chapter you should: 

Be familiar with the case definition for Ebola (Ebola virus disease)
Know the symptoms, signs and complications of Ebola
Understand the disease pathogenesis and progression
Know which other conditions can mimic viral haemorrhagic fevers 
Be familiar with supportive management of Ebola
Know how to transport patients and dispose of corpses safely


CASE DEFINITION AND CLINICAL PRESENTATION
_____________________________________________________________

2-1 What is an outbreak?

An outbreak is the occurrence of more cases (patients) with an infectious disease than would normally be expected for a particular time, place or population. For most outbreaks, infections in two or more people may be linked (if they present with the same symptoms, occurring in the same area and time). For certain life-threatening diseases (such as Ebola and other viral haemorrhagic fevers), even one “case” of the disease is considered an outbreak.




2-2 What is a case definition?

An outbreak case definition is a set of criteria for deciding who should be classified as a case and therefore be included in an outbreak investigation.  It is needed when confirming that an outbreak exists, or when estimating the number of people infected. This definition helps healthcare workers’ decide which patients to classify as suspected disease cases (while waiting for results of confirmatory laboratory tests). The case definition criteria usually combine clinical symptoms or signs and epidemiological risk factors (i.e. travel, time, place and contact with the disease). A case definition is important in identifying people who are suspected of having Ebola.




2-3 Which case definition is being used in the current Ebola outbreak?

A person with signs and/or symptoms of Ebola:

Elevated body temperature or history of fever
Vomiting and/or severe nausea and/or diarrhoea
Severe headache
Fatigue (tiredness)
Muscle pain
Abdominal pain
Unexplained haemorrhage (bleeding)

AND

An epidemiologic risk factor within the 21 days before the onset of symptoms.

The epidemiological risk factor in an Ebola outbreak is based on the probability that the patient has been in contact with someone with Ebola. The epidemiologic risk factor is further classified into 4 risk categories (high, medium, low and no risk) based on the degree of contact with person/s with Ebola and the level of protection used by the exposed individual.

Note: The following risk categories and criteria are used to estimate an individual’s risk of developing Ebola:
Risk 
category
Criteria (any of the following)
High risk
Percutaneous (e.g. needle stick) or mucous membrane exposure to blood or body fluids of a person with Ebola while the person was symptomatic
Exposure to the blood or body fluids of a person with Ebola while the person was symptomatic without appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
Processing blood or body fluids of a person with Ebola while the person was symptomatic without appropriate PPE or standard biosafety precautions
Direct contact with a dead body without appropriate PPE in a country with widespread Ebola virus transmission (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone or Mali)
Having lived in the immediate household and provided direct care to a person with Ebola while the person was symptomatic.
Some risk
In countries with widespread Ebola virus transmission: direct contact while using appropriate PPE with a person with Ebola while the person was symptomatic or with the person's body fluids or any direct patient care in other healthcare settings
Close contact in households, healthcare facilities, or community settings with a person with Ebola while the person was symptomatic
Close contact is defined as a prolonged time within 1 metre of a person with Ebola while the person was symptomatic and not wearing PPE.
Low risk
Having been in a country with widespread Ebola virus transmission within the past 21 days but with no known exposures
Having brief direct contact (e.g. shaking hands) while not wearing appropriate PPE, with a person with Ebola while the person was in the early stage of disease
Brief near (but not touching) a person with Ebola while the person was symptomatic
In any other country, direct contact while using appropriate PPE with a person with Ebola while the person was symptomatic
Travel on an aircraft with a person with Ebola while the person was symptomatic
No risk
Contact with an asymptomatic person who had contact with a person with Ebola
Contact with a person with Ebola before the person developed symptoms
Having been more than 21 days ago to a country with widespread Ebola virus transmission.





2-4 What are the symptoms and signs of Ebola?

The early symptoms of Ebola are non-specific (vague). Symptoms usually start between 4 and 10 days, or as late as 21 days after virus exposure. Common symptoms include:

Fever (temperature above 380C or patient reporting skin feeling hot)
Vomiting and/or severe nausea 
Diarrhoea
Abdominal (stomach) pain
Severe headache
Conjunctivitis (red eyes)
Muscle pain (described by patients as “all over the body” pain)
General weakness and fatigue
Confusion
Unexplained bleeding and/or bruising (from the gums, nose or anus) usually starts about 7 days after the start of symptoms but does not occur in all patients.
Pregnant women may have unexplained vaginal bleeding, miscarriage or premature labour.

Note: The most common symptoms of Ebola are fever, together with vomiting or severe nausea, and/or diarrhoea. Bleeding has occurred in around 5% of patients. For this reason, illness due to Ebola infection has now been renamed ‘Ebola Virus Disease’ rather than ‘Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever’.






2-5 What is the natural history of Ebola?

At the time of exposure, Ebola virus enters the body through mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth) or through broken skin. The virus then invades many different types of cell in the body. The virus multiplies within these cells, causing them to burst and die, with spread of new virus to other cells. During the incubation period (when patients are not infectious), viral multiplication continues until enough cells are affected to cause disease symptoms. Ebola patients are most contagious at or shortly after death, when the level of virus multiplication peaks. 

Note: Ebola virus invades many cell types including cells of the immune system, cells lining the blood vessels and tissue cells in many organs e.g. liver, spleen. The most affected systems are usually organs (resulting in organ failure and shock) and blood vessels/clotting pathways (causing bleeding).





2-6 What are the complications of Ebola? 

The most common complications of Ebola include:

Dehydration (following vomiting and diarrhoea)
Shock (very low blood pressure caused by fluid loss and damage to blood vessels)
Organ failure (kidney and/or liver)
Coagulopathy (clotting disturbances causing bruising and bleeding)
Confusion (uncommonly seizures (fits) and/or coma)
Death.

Most patients progress to develop severe symptoms and disease complications by day 7 of illness. About 60-70% of patients die, although death estimates are variable. For those who do recover (< 30% in the current West African outbreak), improvement occurs around day 10 with discharge often possible by day 14.




2-7 Which other diseases can mimic Ebola?

There are many diseases (both infectious and non-infectious) that have symptoms and signs resembling those of Ebola. For this reason, it is very important that a laboratory sample is submitted to confirm the Ebola diagnosis. Additional laboratory samples may be necessary to exclude other common conditions e.g. malaria. All patients should either be tested for malaria, or given empiric (presumptive) malaria treatment. Patients should be started on malaria treatment while waiting for results of both malaria and Ebola tests.  

Note: Infectious diseases that may be mistaken for Ebola include malaria, Lassa fever and other viral haemorrhagic fevers, bacterial septicaemia (Meningococcus), tuberculosis with haemoptysis, tick bite fever, typhoid, hepatitis A, B, E, and less often C, trypanosomiasis, relapsing fever, plague, leptospirosis, septic abortion, HIV sero-conversion, Q fever, typhus, Herpes simplex virus infection with hepatitis, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, Varicella zoster virus and haemorrhagic measles. Non-infectious illnesses that resemble Ebola include drug sensitivities and overdoses, poisons and toxins, malignant diseases e.g. leukaemia, lymphoma, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and heat stroke.




INITIAL CASE MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORTIVE CARE
_____________________________________________________________

2-8 How should patients with suspected Ebola be transported?

Persons with symptoms and signs of Ebola should be taken to an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) for medical assessment and isolation. Ideally patients should be transported individually; if this is not possible, patients should be transported so that they are not touching each other, and not in contact with body fluids such as vomit or diarrhoea from other patients.

In the worst affected countries, healthcare resources are limited with few ambulances available. In many cases, civilians have to transport sick patients to an ETU. Ideally these individuals should avoid all direct contact (touching) with the sick person and their body fluids. This implies trying to keep a “safe space” around your person, not touching anything unnecessarily, washing hands often and keeping about 2-3 metres away from people. Where close contact is unavoidable, civilians should wear disposable gloves (or if nothing else is available, even plastic bags over their hands), cover their eyes with glasses or sunglasses and wear a face-cover or handkerchief over their mouths. 

For healthcare personnel transporting suspected Ebola patients, personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn (including coveralls, aprons, gloves, visors, respirators and boots, as described in chapter 3). All transport vehicles (private cars and ambulances) should be thorough cleaned with soap and water, followed by disinfection with a 0.5% chlorine-based solution (while wearing PPE to avoid mucous membrane splashes).




2-9 How should patients meeting the case definition be triaged?

Triage is the rapid identification of patients who need urgent management. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends a triage approach called “Identify, Isolate and Inform”. This ensures Ebola suspects are identified upon arrival at a facility using screening questions about possible Ebola exposure and symptoms (based on the case definition). They should then be isolated (removed from general patient areas to a separate area). The relevant authorities and facility staff should be informed of the possible Ebola case.

Wherever possible, patients who meet the case definition of Ebola should be taken to a designated ETU (rather than a routine health facility) where access to Ebola laboratory testing, isolation facilities and appropriate PPE for healthcare workers is available.  Given the current extreme demand for ETU beds, some units will only admit patients with disease complications e.g. dehydration, shock, organ failure. In most units, admitted patients are kept in an “Ebola suspect” area while awaiting Ebola confirmatory blood tests. If found to be positive, the patient should be moved to a “confirmed Ebola” isolation area.

In cases where a person with suspected Ebola presents to a routine healthcare facility i.e. not a designated ETU, healthcare workers should have a standard operating procedure in place.
Where Ebola is suspected, patients should be immediately isolated in a single room with dedicated staff to prevent infection of other patients and staff. The facility management and local ministry of health should be informed immediately.

Patients with suspected Ebola must immediately be isolated from other patients to reduce the risk of spreading the infection

2-10 How should patients with suspected Ebola be separated?

In an ETU suspect isolation area, there may be patients who turn out not to have Ebola (with another cause for their symptoms) and patients who do have Ebola. It is very important that patients admitted to the suspect area are counselled to keep their distance from other patients, and that excellent hygiene is maintained. If carers are admitted together with young children, an alternative carer to look after the children is preferable (some ETUs are using Ebola survivors for this role.) 

Pregnant women are at high risk of severe disease: the placenta, amniotic fluid and foetus are highly infectious. Pregnant women may present with unexplained vaginal bleeding, miscarriage or labour, or may miscarry or deliver while in the ETU. If possible, pregnant women should be separated from other patients in a suspect area. Breastfeeding women should stop breastfeeding, and the baby given formula instead.

2-11 Can some patients be managed at home?

Although most persons with Ebola are extremely ill and require hospitalisation, successful home-based, community care for Ebola cases has been reported. In some instances, community health workers and Ebola survivors have been able to provide limited supportive care by providing patients with food and rehydration fluids only. However the risk of disease transmission to caregivers is high, so they should receive clear instructions on how to avoid becoming infected and how to safely decontaminate the patient’s home (see chapter 5). 
 
2-12 What is supportive care? 
There is currently no approved medicine for specific treatment of Ebola. Patient care focuses on treating symptoms and complications as they appear (so-called supportive care). The key elements of supportive care (which if started early may improve chances of survival) are:
Fluid replacement (with oral rehydration solution given either orally or via the naso-gastric route, or in some cases fluids given intravenously) is very important
Maintenance of blood pressure
Maintenance of normal electrolyte balance (body salts)
Provision of adequate nutrition (calorie supplementation)
Treatment of other infections (e.g. bacterial sepsis, malaria)
Maintenance of oxygen saturation
The level of supportive care provided will depend on the resources available and the policy of the individual healthcare facility or Ebola Treatment Unit. Given the extremely limited healthcare resources and the very high risk of Ebola transmission to healthcare workers, some ETUs provide basic supportive care only. The mainstay of therapy is oral fluid and electrolyte replacement with oral rehydration solution. In severely resource-constrained settings, patients who are recovering have helped and encouraged very ill and dehydrated patients to drink and maintain a good oral intake. In well-resourced settings however, full intensive care facilities with ventilation, blood pressure support, renal dialysis and blood/blood product transfusion may be available.


2-13 What other treatment may be needed?

Ebola may co-infect patients with other common diseases (they have both Ebola plus another disease). Therefore many ETUs provide routine treatment for these other conditions at patient admission. Anti-malarial drugs and broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. cephalosporins) are the most commonly used additional treatments.  Common symptoms of Ebola that need treatment are fever (anti-pyretics), pain (analgesia), nausea and vomiting (anti-emetics) and anxiety/agitation (anxioltytics or sedatives).

Note: Although there are currently no approved Ebola-specific medicines available, several experimental agents are under development. Scientists are focussing efforts on developing treatments for people already infected with the virus e.g. anti-viral drugs (brincidofovir and favipiravir) and plasma transfusions from Ebola survivors, which contain Ebola-specific antibodies to fight the disease. For prevention of Ebola in susceptible or exposed people, scientists are developing and testing vaccines, with two clinical trials currently underway to establish safety and effectiveness.

2-14 Are pregnant woman at higher risk of death from Ebola?

Pregnant women with Ebola are a group at increased risk of severe disease and death. Spontaneous abortion and pregnancy related haemorrhage are common, posing additional risks to others. Intra-uterine foetal death is common at presentation; all liveborn neonates to date have subsequently died. The foetus, placenta, amniotic fluid and breast milk are highly infectious, and remain infectious even if the mother survives and her blood subsequently tests negative for Ebola.

2-15 Which patient observations should be done?

Patient temperature monitoring is not strictly necessary, as all patients are given anti-pyretics. It may be useful though in the recovery period, to document absence of fever. During patient observation rounds, symptoms and complications should be noted. 

The purpose of recording these basic observations is to:
Monitor patient progress 
Ensure that symptoms are well controlled, e.g. vomiting, pain
Allow for objective decision making about discharge in recovered patients. 

Any observations that require invasive procedures e.g. blood glucose estimation, could potentially result in needle stick injury to healthcare workers (with inoculation of virus). For this reason all invasive procedures should be carefully considered. If the procedure is truly required, it should be conducted with adequate staff, good lighting, sharps containers and preferably with use of safety-engineered devices.

FURTHER MANAGEMENT
_______________________________________________________________

2-16 Should patients be resuscitated after collapse?

In the majority of ETU’s in the 3 worst affected countries, there are no facilities to provide intensive care for Ebola patients. In addition, there is an extremely high risk of Ebola transmission to healthcare workers during resuscitation attempts. For both these reasons, active attempts at patient resuscitation are not widely supported. In well-resourced settings, with ability to provide intensive care, resuscitation may be considered.

2-17 Should patients with Ebola receive surgical intervention or operations if needed?

This is an extremely controversial topic, as surgery performed on patients with Ebola poses a serious risk of Ebola infection should healthcare workers sustain needle stick injuries or cuts during the procedure. For this reason most ETU to date have not performed surgical operations, although under ideal and controlled conditions, operations could be performed. 

2-18 What psychological support should be provided?

The psychological trauma suffered by Ebola patients is severe, with most survivors witnessing the death of fellow patients at an ETU and experiencing loss of some family members. In addition to this, many survivors are stigmatised or even ostracised by their communities when they return home. For this reason, extensive counselling and support should be provided to Ebola survivors, before and after discharge. However given the scale of the current outbreak this will be challenging.

2-19 What are the criteria for patient discharge?

Patients whose major symptoms have resolved, who are fever-free for at least 3 days, have no significant ongoing symptoms and are able to care for themselves independently, may be considered for discharge. Some ETU’s require a negative laboratory test for Ebola (the Ebola PCR) as a marker that the patient is no longer infectious prior to discharge. 

Ebola patients who have clinically recovered and have been fever-free of at least 3 days can be considered for discharge

2-20 What support is needed after patient discharge?

There should be a defined discharge protocol and discharge area. When patients are discharged from the high risk area, they need to wash thoroughly (soap and water) to remove virus contaminating their skin and hair.  Patients’ clothing and shoes should be disinfected (by washing in 0.05% chlorine solution) before discharge or replaced if heavily contaminated. 

The patient should be accompanied home by a healthcare worker (or community health worker/health promoter) to explain to the family and their community that they are no longer infectious. Most Ebola survivors will need ongoing care and support in the weeks following discharge to ensure food security, provide psychological support and establish successful re-integration into the community. Male patients should be counselled about the prolonged excretion of virus in semen (up to 3 months), and should be supplied with condoms on discharge.

2-21 How should corpses of Ebola victims be prepared for disposal?

Bodies are most infectious around and just after death - the reason is extravasation (leaking out) of blood and body fluids from the patient. Ebola is fragile but can survive up to 5 days or longer under favourable conditions. Whether in a healthcare facility or at home, a dead body must be treated with dignity and systems must be put in place for the family and relatives to give the person a decent send-off including permission to say prayers albeit from afar without contact with the body. The body must be handled with respect. 

Only trained workers should be allowed to handle infected human remains. Personal protective equipment (PPE, preferably coveralls) should be used before contact with the body, both during collection and placement in body bags. The PPE should be removed with care not to contaminate the wearer, discarded appropriately and followed by hand washing with soap and water (if hands visibly soiled) or with 70% alcohol-based handrub or 0.5% chlorine solution (if not visibly contaminated). 

The body should be prepared as follows:

Spread out a waterproof sheet which is larger than the body
The corpse should not be washed 
Any medical devices (tubes, drips) should be left in place
Gently lift the body onto the sheet and place it in the centre of the sheet
At this point the family may be asked if they wish to say a prayer or bid farewell
Lift the corners of the sheet and place the body inside the cadaver bag and zip it closed
Gently lift and place the first cadaver bag inside a second cadaver bag and zip closed
Spray the outside of the cadaver bag with 0.05% chlorine then allow to dry
Carry the body out by the four corners of the bag and place it on a transportation system.

Corpses of people who have died of Ebola are highly infectious and should be handled with great care

2-22 Are family members allowed to participate in safe burials? 

Traditional burial practices in some west African countries involve washing and touching of the corpse by family members and people attending the burial. This traditional practice has been linked with many cases of Ebola transmission and is thought to play a major role in spreading Ebola. In order to avoid this risk, healthcare workers and ministries of health are trying to encourage communities to practice so-called “safe burials”. This concept is at odds with social and cultural rituals, and so the procedure should be clearly explained to family members and community leaders, preferably with the help of a health promoter. 

It is essential to allow the family to participate in the process, in order to fulfil their traditional and personal needs. The following are suggested ways in which the family could be involved:

Preparation of a coffin 
Preparation of a grave (at least 2 metres deep)
Attendance of family at the burial should be encouraged
Lowering of the coffin/body bags into the grave (wearing gloves)
Shovelling sand into the grave to cover the coffin/body bags
Performing traditional burial rites (dance, songs) at the funeral.

In the event of a death in the community, health promotion messaging should educate people not to touch and bury the corpse. A contact number for reporting of possible Ebola deaths should be available. Medical teams can then assess the risk and if necessary disinfect the house, safely prepare the corpse and assist the family with arrangements for a safe burial.

CASE STUDY 
______________________________________________________

A 35-year old woman collapses at home after a short illness, with symptoms of vomiting, diarrhoea and fever. She attended the funeral of a family member (who had suspected Ebola) in a village in Guinea a week before, where she helped prepare the body. A concerned family member calls the local ambulance to take her to an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) for assessment.

1. Does this woman fulfil the case definition for suspected Ebola?

Yes, she has both symptoms which suggest Ebola and an epidemiological risk factor (touching a possibly Ebola-infected corpse) within the 21 days before the onset of her symptoms.

2. What precautions should the ambulance staff take?

For healthcare workers transporting suspected Ebola patients, full personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn (including coveralls, aprons, gloves, visors, respirators and boots). The ambulance should be thorough cleaned with soap and water, followed by disinfection with a 0.5% chlorine-based solution (while wearing PPE to avoid mucous membrane splashes).

3. How should staff at the Ebola Treatment Unit manage this patient?

On arrival at the ETU, staff should establish whether she meets the case definition, take blood samples for laboratory confirmation of Ebola and assess whether she has complications requiring admission. For patients requiring admission, supportive care is provided which includes rehydration and presumptive treatment for malaria and bacterial sepsis. Symptomatic treatment for fever, pain, nausea, vomiting etc will also be provided.

4. Despite the medical team’s best efforts, the woman dies from confirmed Ebola two weeks later. How should her body be prepared for a safe burial?

The woman’s corpse is highly contagious and so only trained workers would be allowed to prepare her body, while wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE). Her body would be wrapped in a leak-proof plastic and 2 x 150 micron thick zip-able body bags. Between each layer, the outer surfaces of the body bags must be wiped down with 0.5% chlorine solution and allowed to dry. Once ready for burial, the family should be allowed to assist with arrangements and attendance at the burial.

5. What else needs to be done in this case?

Staff at the ETU should arrange for contact tracing to identify other people who participated in the burial and others who had close contact with her after she developed symptoms (e.g. nursed her at home, washed her bedding and clothes, cleaned the house or was in contact with vomit, diarrhoea). Contacts need close monitoring for fever and symptoms during the 21-day incubation period. Education and counselling to her contacts will ensure they know what to do/who to contact if they are unwell. In addition, a home disinfection team should visit her house to clean and disinfect the contents and surfaces.

Protection of Healthcare Workers

Objectives 

When you have completed this chapter you should: 

Be familiar with standard, contact and droplet precautions for Ebola
Understand the importance of and methods for hand hygiene
Know which items of personal protective equipment are required
Be familiar with the correct sequence for putting on and taking off protective equipment
Be aware of additional hazards to healthcare workers

STANDARD AND ISOLATION PRECAUTIONS
_____________________________________________________________

3-1 How is Ebola transmitted to healthcare workers?

Virus is transmitted through direct or indirect contact with bodily fluids from a person who is ill with Ebola (e.g. blood, urine, vomitus, faeces). Healthcare workers may become infected directly when any of these fluids enter their mucous membranes (eyes, mouth, nose), non-intact skin (open sore) or through accidental cuts or needle stick injuries. Transmission can also occur indirectly through contact with a contaminated object e.g. medical equipment, protective equipment or surface. 

3-2 When are healthcare workers at highest risk of contracting Ebola?

The risk to Ebola-exposed healthcare workers is greatest when they:

Do not consider the possibility of an Ebola diagnosis
Are not following procedures outlined in standard precautions guidelines
Are not following correct procedures for use of personal protective equipment
Have contact with extremely ill or dying Ebola patients or corpses
Clean blood and/or body fluid spills from Ebola-infected patients.

3-3 What are standard precautions?

Standard infection control precautions are actions that reduce the chance of infection transmission from both known and unknown (unrecognised) sources of infection. They protect healthcare workers, patients and staff from acquiring infection. Standard precautions should be applied to all patients in at all times, whether or not they are known to pose an infection risk. 
The reasons for using standard precautions for all patients at all times are:

A patient may show no signs or symptoms of infection at the time of consultation or treatment, but may be infectious (however Ebola is not known to be infectious before symptoms are present) 
A patient may be an asymptomatic carrier of an organism or may be colonized with multidrug-resistant microorganisms
The infectious status of a patient is often only confirmed after laboratory tests or tests may not be done due to lack of laboratory facilities and/or resources
The clinician may fail to take a proper patient history or may not realise the possibility of an infectious cause for the patient’s symptoms.

All healthcare workers should be trained in the use of standard precautions. The diagram below shows the elements that make up standard precautions with hand hygiene, protective clothing and patient placement (isolation) being some of the most important precautions in management of Ebola cases.

 




3-4 What are transmission-based precautions?

Transmission-based precautions (TBP) are actions aimed at reducing specific modes of infection transmission e.g. airborne precautions for tuberculosis (TB); contact precautions for Ebola. Remember that TBP are always applied in addition to standard precautions. Bear in mind too that some pathogens have more than one route of transmission e.g in addition to standard and contact precautions, Ebola needs droplet precautions to protect against droplet exposures when patients are vomiting.




3-5 What are contact and droplet precautions?

In addition to standard precautions, these are types of transmission-based precautions applied for Ebola, and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Unlike tuberculosis, Ebola is not spread through the airborne route. For this reason airborne precautions and negative pressure ventilation are generally not required (except when performing aerosol-generating procedures e.g. intubation, bronchoscopy). 

Droplet and airborne transmission are both forms of disease spread via the respiratory route but the precautions (actions) needed for prevention differ. Droplets are large (greater than 5 microns) and spread only about 1 metre (3 feet) from the patient. For droplet precautions, mucous membrane cover (visors/masks) is needed. Airborne spread occurs via inhalation of tiny respiratory particles (less than 5 microns) containing pathogen; negative pressure, closed doors and respirators for staff are needed. The table below summarises the various elements of standard, contact and droplet precautions for Ebola.






Recommended isolation precautions for Ebola
Component
Recommendation
Precautions required
Standard precautions: For all patients at all times
Contact precautions: Virus can be acquired by direct contact with blood and/or bodily fluids or indirect contact with virus-contaminated surfaces, items or equipment. 
Droplet precautions: Virus (in respiratory droplets), generated with forceful coughing or vomiting could spread to nearby surfaces resulting in extensive contamination.
Risk-prone procedures
Touching the patient, and/or blood and/or body fluids, and/or contaminated items/equipment without wearing the recommended personal protective equipment. Very high risk procedures would include insertion and suctioning of endotracheal tubes, nasogastric tubes and surgical procedures. For aerosol generating procedures only e.g. intubation/suctioning, airborne precautions are advised.
Patient placement
Ideally single room with en-suite bathroom/toilet is required, but in an outbreak settings, cohort isolation is used (where two or more patients with confirmed Ebola virus disease are placed together in a single room/area). For suspected (but as yet unconfirmed Ebola cases) the same precautions apply, but these patients are cohorted in a separate location to patients with confirmed disease. Ideally the isolation area should be access-controlled, with a security officer controlling access and recording the names of healthcare workers and the times they entered the isolation area.
Patient Care Considerations
Keep all procedures (phlebotomy etc.) to an absolute minimum required for care. Handle contaminated needles and sharps with extreme caution, and dispose all type of contaminated sharps in a puncture-proof, sealed container. The sharps containers must be available at point of care.
Equipment and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• In order to alert healthcare workers entering Ebola patient care areas, all entry must be restricted to staff wearing full PPE and large, clearly understandable signs (stating the requirement for contact and droplet precautions) should be posted at the entrance. When seeing patients outside of an Ebola treatment unit, precautions should be applied when within 1 metre (3 feet) of a patient including as a minimum: alcohol handrub, non-sterile gloves, disposable aprons, waterproof mask/respirator and eye protection (see detailed PPE recommendations below).
Patient equipment
Dedicated items/equipment or adequate cleaning with appropriate disinfection of shared equipment.
Clinical Waste
Put in clinical (infectious) waste box, box to be labelled as Biohazards waste
Ventilation
No special requirements
Environmental cleaning
Dedicated cleaning equipment or clean room last.Terminal cleaning indicated on patient discharge. (see chapter 4)
Discontinue precautions
Only once patient is discharged.

HAND HYGIENE
_____________________________________________________________

3-6 What is hand hygiene?

Hand hygiene is one of the most important ways to reduce the transmission of infections in healthcare settings, including outbreaks. Hand hygiene includes any activity that reduces the level of skin contamination with micro-organisms e.g. handwashing, alcohol-based handrub, antiseptic handwash and surgical handscrub.




3-7 Why is hand hygiene important in Ebola virus disease outbreaks?

Effective hand hygiene is an extremely important way to reduce healthcare workers’ risk of contracting Ebola. The main route of Ebola spread is through direct and indirect contact. By washing hands after all contact with patients, the patient environment, medical items/equipment and personal protective equipment, healthcare workers reduce the chances of introducing virus to their mucous membranes.

3-8 Which methods of hand hygiene are recommended?

• Routine handwashing with ordinary soap or antimicrobial soap and water should be performed for at least 40–60 seconds. This method of hand hygiene must be used when hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with blood and/or body fluids.
• Alcohol-based handrub should be applied over the entire surface area of the hands, using proper technique (see figures at the end of the chapter). Hands should remain wet for at least 15 seconds and then allowed to dry completely (20–30 seconds altogether). Alcohol handrub is very effective but should not be used if hands are visibly soiled with dirt, blood or body fluids.

The WHO has developed 2 posters that summarise the techniques of hand washing and hand rub (see end of chapter).

3-9 What is alcohol hand rub?

Alcohol handrub is a manufactured hand hygiene product (antiseptic) containing at least 60–80% alcohol e.g. isopropanol, ethanol or n-propanol. Emollients (moisturising agents) such as glycerol are added to reduce the drying and damaging effect of alcohol on skin. Alcohol penetrates the viral envelope (and bacterial and fungal cell membranes), causing damage to and killing the micro-organism. To achieve maximal killing of micro-organisms, the alcohol must be in contact with the skin for at least several seconds, at sufficient concentrations, and allowed to dry. It is almost always better to use alcohol handrub, rather than soap and water (except when hands are visibly contaminated with blood and/or body fluids). The handrub procedure is faster than hand-washing, less drying to the skin and achieves better and faster killing of micro-organisms. The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced two formulations (“recipes”) for pharmacies to locally produce alcohol hand rub (see resources).

Note: Alcohol denatures the viral envelope and bacterial or fungal membranes.




3-10 What are the five moments for hand hygiene?

The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five times when hand hygiene should be performed by healthcare workers. They are called the “WHO Five Moments for Hand Hygiene” and form part of a global hand hygiene awareness initiative. The five moments include:
• Before touching a patient  
• Before a clean/aseptic procedure (or task) 
• After body fluid exposure 
• After touching a patient  
• After touching patient surroundings.

The last of the five moments, after contact with the patient’s surroundings, is the hand hygiene opportunity that is most often missed or not clearly understood by healthcare workers. The healthcare environment includes anything in the immediate patient’s surroundings (e.g. heart/saturation monitors, patient charts, bedside tables). Healthcare workers should take particular care to perform hand hygiene after touching these objects or surfaces.


1-10 What is hand washing?


3-11 Should 0.05% chlorinated solutions be used for hand hygiene?

No, this practice is not encouraged because:
Chlorine has not been shown to be as effective as handwashing with soap and water or alcohol handrub
Chlorine needs a longer skin contact time to be effective
Repeated washing with chlorine can irritate and/or damage the skin, which can increase the chance of Ebola virus entering the body through broken skin.

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)
_____________________________________________________________

3-12 What is personal protective equipment?

Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes specialized clothing or equipment worn by healthcare workers to protect them from exposure to pathogens, e.g. gloves, aprons, face covers. It is important to note that the use of PPE is not a substitute for proper infection control practice. For example, wearing gloves instead of washing hands is unacceptable, as healthcare workers’ hands may still become contaminated through the gloves.

Wearing gloves instead of washing hands is not acceptable

3-13 Which items of personal protective equipment are recommended for Ebola?

The recommendations for personal protective equipment (PPE) for Ebola will vary depending on the organisation or institution and which items are available at any particular time. The most important principle is that the PPE used should cover ALL of the healthcare worker’s mucous membranes and skin. In general, the following items are needed (as part of the contact and droplet precautions):

Head and neck cover:  balaclava, hood or cap
Eye cover: goggles or face-shield
Mouth and nose cover: Water-resistant mask or respirator (if not wearing a face-shield)
Body cover: coveralls, or waterproof gown PLUS apron
Foot cover: Boots 
Hand covers: two pairs of gloves.

3-14 Which types of eye protection are recommended?

Any eye-cover that adequately protects the healthcare worker’s conjunctival mucous membranes from splashes is acceptable. Either goggles or face-shields can be used. Normal reading glasses are not acceptable, as fluid splashes can still reach the wearer’s eyes. Fogging (misting up) can be a problem when using some types of goggles.

3-15 Which types of facecovers are recommended?

Healthcare workers’ need to cover the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose to avoid body fluid splashes. A surgical mask or N95 respirator is acceptable. The WHO recommends a structured mask (so-called “face-off” mask). Ideally a face-shield should be worn over the mask/respirator.

3-16 Which types of head cover are recommended?

Healthcare workers’ must ensure that no skin is left exposed. A headcover that also protects the neck and sides of the head e.g. balaclava, is the most suitable as it provides better skin coverage, although other types of head covers may be used.


3-17 Which types of gowns are recommended?

Ideally the healthcare worker should change out of their private clothes into cool and comfortable “underclothes” which are worn underneath the PPE. A water-proof (fluid-resistant), disposable gown or disposable coverall is then worn over this. The use of gowns versus coveralls will depend on local policy and availability, although gowns may be cooler and easier to safely remove than coveralls. If wearing a gown, the gown must be long enough to cover the top of the healthcare worker’s boots.

3-18 Which types of footwear are recommended?

Ideally the healthcare worker should wear correctly-sized gum boots. WHO does not recommend the use of overshoes if wearing boots. If boots are not available, other closed, puncture-proof and fluid-resistant shoes, with overshoes to protect the surface from splashes could be used (although this option is not recommended).

3-19 Which types of apron are recommended?

Aprons must be worn over the gown or coverall to reduce contamination levels of the PPE by blood and body fluids. Thin plastic aprons are disposable, whereas the heavy-duty, thick plastic aprons may be re-used if safe disinfection can be ensured. 

3-20 Which types of gloves are recommended?

Correctly sized latex or nitrile (non-sterile examination) gloves should be used. In all instances, double gloving (i.e. 2 layers of gloves) should be used. If gloves are damaged, torn or heavily contaminated during use, they should be replaced. New gloves should be used between each patient. For environmental cleaning or waste management, heavy duty rubber gloves should be used.

USING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)

3-21 What is a personal protective equipment buddy?

The dressing (donning of PPE) and undressing (doffing of PPE) procedures should be supervised by a trained healthcare worker.  This person, known as a “PPE buddy”, helps with the dressing procedure to ensure that no skin is left exposed and that all PPE has been correctly fitted. During undressing, the buddy helps to prevent contamination with blood or body fluids transferred from the protective clothing. The PPE buddy should be appropriately dressed to avoid contaminating themselves or their clothing i.e. long-sleeved gown, apron, mask, visor, long cuffed gloves. The procedure for putting on and taking off PPE should ideally take place in two separate areas, specifically designated for that purpose, to avoid contamination of clean PPE during undressing.




3-22 How should personal protective equipment be put on?

The usual sequence for putting on (donning) PPE (assisted by the PPE buddy) is: 

1. First pair of gloves
2. Coverall or Gown
3. Boots
4. Overshoes
5. Apron
6. Mask or N95 respirator 
7. If using a coverall, pull hood on
8. Goggles or visor or face-shield
9. Balaclava or head/neck cover
10. Second pair of gloves.

3-23 How should personal protective equipment be removed?

Follow your local recommended guideline for PPE removal or use the sequence recommended by the WHO:

1. Remove the outer pair of gloves and discard immediately in waste box (see images below) 

2. The PPE buddy sprays the worker’s hands (still in the second set of gloves) with alcohol 

3. Remove the plastic apron (if disposable, roll it dirty side inwards and discard in waste box, if it is reusable place in a container with disinfectant)

4. If wearing overshoes, remove and discard immediately in waste box

The healthcare worker and PPE buddy then move to a specified PPE removal (doffing) area. This area should be visibly divided (demarcated) into a “contaminated” area (where the healthcare worker undresses) and “clean” area (where the PPE buddy stands to assist). 

5. Remove the gown by folding the dirty side inwards on itself or unzip the coverall and remove the coverall hood; roll the top section of the coverall down to the hips; then when seated, pull the coverall carefully over the boots.

6. Remove the boots or shoes. Place the boots in a container with disinfectant.

7. Remove the gloves and perform hand hygiene.

8.  Remove the balaclava or head and neck cover.

9.  Remove the goggles or face-shield (if re-usable, place it in a plastic bag to be taken for disinfection).

10. Remove the N95 respirator or mask. Untie or remove the bottom string first. 

11. Wash hands with soap and water before leaving the undressing room.








How to remove gloves





Pinch one glove at the wrist level to remove it without touching the skin of the forearm, and peel away from the hand, allowing the glove to turn inside out

Hold the removed glove in the gloved hand and slide the fingers of the ungloved hand inside between the glove and the wrist. Remove the secong glove by rolling it down the hand and fold into the first glove.
Discard the removed gloves in an appropriate waste container
Perform hand hygiene  with 70% alcohol handrub (if hands visibly clean) or with soap and water (if visibly contaminated)

3-24 How long can one work while dressed in personal protective equipment?

When dressed in full PPE for Ebola, especially in warm climates, a healthcare worker can easily develop heat-stress and dehydration. For this reason, it is recommended that healthcare workers should spend an hour of less in the patient area before leaving and removing the PPE. Ideally, healthcare workers should mentally prepare a list of all tasks to complete while inside the patient area (e.g. observations, giving medicine, providing food) to avoid having to enter repeatedly.

3-25 Where should used, disposable personal protective equipment be discarded?

All disposable PPE items, whether visibly contaminated or not, should be discarded immediately after removal in a medical waste box. Do not be tempted to “save” or “recycle” single-use (disposable) items as the danger in disinfecting them outweighs the potential cost saving. 





3-26 What should be done with re-usable personal protective equipment?

All items that are re-usable (e.g. goggles, gum boots) should be carefully placed in plastic packets during the undressing procedure. These packets are then sealed and taken by the PPE buddy to the disinfection area, where they should be immediately cleaned, disinfected and dried for subsequent use.

3-27 What must the healthcare worker do once all personal protective equipment has been removed?

The healthcare worker should wash hands with soap and water after removing all PPE, before leaving the undressing area. Depending on local circumstances and guidelines, a healthcare worker may then proceed to a changing area to shower and put on their own clothes. 

3-28 What should healthcare workers do if personal protective equipment is not available?

Caring for patients with Ebola, in the absence of appropriate PPE poses a major hazard to healthcare workers. There is direct conflict between a healthcare worker’s duty of patient care and their need for self-protection (to avoid acquiring disease and being unable to care for others).  There is no simple answer to this question, so healthcare workers’ would need to make a decision based on a risk-assessment of the situation.

Healthcare workers should take every available precaution to protect themselves against becoming infected

RISK MANAGEMENT
_____________________________________________________________

3-29 How can healthcare workers reduce their risk of Ebola exposures?

To reduce the risk of infection, healthcare workers should routinely apply standard precautions in all circumstances. Patients at risk of Ebola should be identified promptly (using the case definition) and triaged swiftly to an isolation area while waiting for assessment. If Ebola is suspected, healthcare workers should use PPE as described above. Special care must be taken when removing PPE, not to become contaminated with blood and/or body fluids. Hand hygiene should be practiced using the WHO 5 moments for hand hygiene indications (see figure at end of the chapter). Contact with Ebola cases should be restricted to essential, trained staff only, to reduce the number of workers exposed. Invasive procedures should be limited to absolutely essential investigations and procedures only, with extreme caution when handling and disposing of needles and sharps. Contaminated surfaces and equipment must be appropriately and safely cleaned and disinfected to avoid exposure after indirect contact.

It is very important that exposed healthcare workers follow strict protocols to protect themselves and their families

3-30 How can healthcare workers reduce their risk of exposing their families?

Healthcare workers in Ebola-affected countries (who have direct patient contact) are at high risk for Ebola, especially if they do not apply precautions appropriately. Ebola is not infectious in the incubation period. As long as an individual remains healthy, they do not pose a danger to their families or colleagues. Healthcare workers with known Ebola exposure/s or those working in Ebola Treatment Units should carefully monitor their own health. This requires self-monitoring for possible Ebola symptoms and twice daily recording of body temperature (for 21 days after exposure i.e. during the incubation period). Should a healthcare worker have fever or any symptoms of Ebola they should avoid all physical contact and report for Ebola testing as soon as possible. Remember that in the early stages of Ebola, the viral test (PCR) may be negative and will need to be repeated 48 hours later.

3-31 What other risks do healthcare workers face during outbreaks?

All healthcare workers (whether local or foreign volunteers) remain at risk for other infectious diseases that occur in the outbreak area e.g. malaria and diarrhoeal diseases in West Africa. Adequate precautions, vaccines and/or prophylaxis should be taken as indicated. Management of non-infectious issues e.g. road traffic accidents and non-communicable diseases in healthcare staff may be challenging as health systems are often unable to manage in outbreak situations. Another risk in the current Ebola outbreak has been physical violence towards healthcare workers and Ebola Treatment Units, although this has been sporadic. 

3-32 How soon can healthcare workers return to routine work after returning from Ebola-affected regions?

This has been a controversial issue particularly for healthcare workers returning home to non-Ebola affected regions of the world. If they have no symptoms, healthcare workers in some settings may be allowed to return to work immediately (since individuals are not infectious during incubation.) As a minimum, healthcare workers should self-monitor for Ebola symptoms and fever during the 21 day incubation period post last Ebola exposure. As a precautionary measure, many health authorities have discouraged healthcare workers from using public transport and attending mass gatherings during the 21-day post exposure period.

CASE STUDY 
______________________________________________________

A nurse from Sierra Leone is recruited to work at an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in Freetown. He asks the following questions to the course facilitator during his preparatory training on Ebola Infection Prevention and Control.

1. When is my risk of contracting Ebola the greatest?

The risk to Ebola-exposed healthcare workers is greatest when they:

 Do not consider the possibility of an Ebola diagnosis in their patients
Are not following procedures outlined in standard precaution guidelines
Are not following correct procedures for use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
Have contact with severely ill or dying Ebola patients or corpses
Clean blood and/or body fluid spills from Ebola-infected patients without adequate precautions.

2. What can I do to reduce my risk of getting Ebola?

Healthcare workers can reduce the chance of acquiring Ebola from their patients by:

Routinely applying standard precautions for all patients and at all times
Identifying patients at risk of Ebola promptly using the case definition 
Removing (triaging) persons with suspected Ebola to an isolation area while waiting for assessment
Wearing all the recommended PPE correctly when in contact with suspected and confirmed Ebola cases
Taking extreme care when removing the PPE to avoid contaminated with blood and/or body fluids
Practicing hand hygiene using the WHO 5 moments for hand hygiene indications
Restricting contact with Ebola cases to essential, trained staff only
Limiting invasive procedures for patients with Ebola to essential investigations and procedures only
Practicing extreme caution when handling and disposing of contaminated needles and sharps
Paying attention to environmental disinfection of Ebola-contaminated surfaces and equipment.
 
3. What personal protective equipment will I need to wear?

The recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) for Ebola will vary depending on the organisation/institution and which items are available at any particular time. The PPE used should cover all of the healthcare worker’s mucous membranes and skin. In general, the following items are needed (as part of the contact and droplet precautions):

Head and Neck cover: balaclava, hood or cap
Eye cover: goggles or face-shield
Mouth and nose cover: surgical mask or respirator
Body cover: coveralls or fluid-resistant gown PLUS apron
Foot cover: Boots 
Hand covers: two pairs of gloves.

Putting on (donning of PPE) and taking off (doffing of PPE) procedures should be supervised by a trained healthcare worker.  This person, known as a “PPE buddy”, helps with the putting on PPE correctly, to ensure that no skin is left exposed and that all PPE has been correctly fitted. When removing PPE, the buddy helps to prevent contamination with blood and/or body fluids transferred from the protective clothing. The PPE buddy should be appropriately dressed to avoid contaminating themselves or their clothing i.e. long-sleeved gown, apron, mask, visor, long cuffed gloves. 

4. Are my family at risk of getting Ebola from me?

Healthcare workers in Ebola-affected countries (who have direct patient contact) are at high risk for Ebola, especially if they do not apply precautions appropriately. Ebola is not infectious in the incubation period. As long as an individual remains symptom free (healthy), they do not pose a danger to their families or colleagues. Healthcare workers with known Ebola exposure or those working in ETU should carefully monitor their own health. This requires self-monitoring for possible Ebola symptoms and twice daily recording of body temperature (for 21 days after exposure). Should a healthcare worker have fever or any symptoms suggesting Ebola they should avoid all physical contact and report for Ebola testing as soon as possible. Remember that in the early stages of Ebola, the viral test (PCR) may be negative and should be repeated 48 hours later.

SUPPORT SERVICES
_____________________________________________________________

4-1 What are healthcare support services?

Support services work behind the scenes in healthcare to make sure that clinical staff, patients and visitors are safe and cared for. Unfortunately the staff working in support services are often neglected when providing training. Infection control (IPC) programmes need simple but solid training programmes for these staff to ensure they are adequately informed and protected with knowledge and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). No healthcare delivery system can function without a well organised infrastructure.

4-2 What is the role of support services in management of Ebola outbreaks?

The work of the support service teams is absolutely critical to the smooth operation and safety of patients and healthcare workers in outbreak settings. They essentially provide a safe environment in a busy and potentially highly infectious work setting. In Ebola outbreaks, there is excessive use of personal protective equipment (PPE), water, electricity, medical equipment, linen and disposal of infectious waste. Well trained support staff will ensure a safer working environment for themselves, healthcare staff and patients, particularly when handling laundry and infectious waste.




4-3 Which support services are required?

In any healthcare facility whether it is an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) or a regular healthcare facility dealing with possible suspected cases of Ebola, the following aspects must be considered:

Obtaining PPE and IPC equipment to provide a consistent supply of quality products
Essential supplies- ventilation, water and electricity for health and IPC needs
Ensuring that patient care articles such as bedpan, jugs and urinals are safe
Decontamination and sterilization of medical devices
Environmental cleaning and disinfection in high and medium risk areas
Managing linen safely
Managing both infectious and non-infectious waste with minimal risk
Design, layout and workflow to ensure minimum transmission
Essential documentation towards containing the outbreak

Standard operating procedures (SOPs) must be in place as visual reminders to reduce occupationally acquired exposure in support services staff. They must understand the risk to themselves, know how to conduct their work safely and realise the critical role they play in the healthcare service. They should be recognised as an integral and essential part of the infection control (IPC) team and must be treated as such.

4-4 Who should co-ordinate the support services?

Ideally, the administration of the healthcare facility should ensure that these services are in place and are function properly. Each facility should appoint a technical co-ordinator, assisted by a multi-disciplinary team to manage and advise on technical issues. 

In a crisis situation like an Ebola outbreak, there are often major shortages of PPE, IPC equipment and other essentials. There is also huge pressure on an already fragile healthcare infrastructure. Organisations supporting the Ebola epidemic should work together with the health administrators and facility technical co-ordinators to ensure that the correct amount of good quality equipment is purchased and used. It is a team effort and needs to be based on trust and supply of accurate information. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with the government to ensure an uninterrupted supply of support services. Support services are part of the healthcare delivery team, same as IPC.

PROCUREMENT OF PROVISIONS FOR INFECTION CONTROL
_____________________________________________________________

4-5 What is procurement of provisions?

Procurement is the buying of goods needed for healthcare service delivery. It is a complex business especially in countries where the supply chain is unreliable. In many outbreak settings or countries with weak healthcare systems, lack of essential stock items in hospitals is common. Additional challenges include inadequate quality control of items and absence of electronic stock control systems. In most of these settings, manual records are kept making it difficult to track which items are needed. A good procurement system should monitor usage and distribution of items, with a stock replacement system (that can give accurate updates on current stock supplies).

Procurement is the buying of goods needed for the delivery of healthcare services

4-6 Which essential items should be procured?

It is very difficult to estimate the exact needs of any particular unit in an outbreak setting, but certain essential items are required to ensure adequate infection control standards (based on the WHO guidelines, September 2014).

Category of item
What is required
Comments
Hand hygiene supplies 
Running water 
Soap 
Disposable towels 
Alcohol handrub (or if not available, chlorine solution at 0.05%, although this is not recommended by WHO)
Running water can be supplied from municipal services (if reliable) or water containers. If no disposable hand towels, can have personal use towels. 

Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Clothes or theatre scrubs
Rubber/gum boots  
Sets of PPE with the following:
Non-sterile examination gloves 
Domestic (rubber) gloves
Water resistant gown or coveralls 
Disposable plastic aprons or reusable ones
Face covers or fluid resistant surgical masks or respirators
Face shields or goggles 
Head gear e.g. hood to cover head and neck.
All staff must change out of their “street” clothes. Each worker will need a pair of boots (preferably one size larger for easy removal). If boots are not available, slip-on shoes without laces that cover the full foot are an option, together with fluid resistant shoe covers. Double gloving is required in all clinical areas. Domestic gloves are needed for burial, linen and waste management duties. Coveralls are preferred if working in Support Services. If using reusable aprons they must be robust to withstand repeated exposure to chlorine.) Surgical masks are worn with face shields or can be “off the face” fluid resistant types worn with goggles. Face shields are less prone to fogging up and give more visibility to the worker. 
Waste management
Red bags and containers for infectious waste
Robust sharps containers
Black bags for general waste
A method for final disposal of waste 
A convenient place for storage, treatment and final disposal
Some facilities may use yellow bags for biohazardous waste, but red bags are preferred. For final waste disposal (after appropriate treatment) the simplest and cheapest method would be to use an incinerator. This however causes environmental pollution with health risks so better technologies e.g. autoclaving are being made available, at low cost, specifically designed for low-resource settings. 
Environmental cleaning and disinfectants (refer to WHO guidelines)
Supply of clean water
Chlorine liquid 
Detergents (not washing up liquid!)
Ammonia-based cleaners for toilets and baths
Cloths (wiping/drying)
Mops (floors/toilets)
Chlorine liquid can be accurately diluted to give the correct concentration. The correct method for application is to use a cloth soaked in the correct dilution of chlorine and apply it evenly. Allow to dry.
Random spraying of the environment with disinfectants is not recommended. Quality control of detergents and disinfectants is important, especially in hot African climates, where some products may be unstable. Disinfectants should be stored in dry and cool areas.
Linen/mattresses
Linen for beds 
Mattresses with impervious rubber covers

Sterilisation services
Indicators for sterilizers, Bowie Dick test, chemical and biological indicators

Clinical supplies
Laboratory sampling tubes and bottles
Needles, syringes
All essential items and equipment should be into a dry, cool and secure store room.

4-8 Why is the quality of the items important?

Good quality equipment is essential to protect healthcare workers and patients. However purchases must be cost-effective. Ideally the procurement or logistics staff, together with someone with IPC experience, should review all items before ordering. The following issues should be considered:
Developing an essential items lists, with minimum stock levels
A method to ensure stock recording and control
The lag-time for an order to be made and delivered (how long will it take)
The minimum amount of essential stock needed (calculated as “one on the ward, one discarded off the ward and one on the way”)
The product quality (items will need to withstand heavy use and constant application of disinfectants)
Whether manufacturer’s instructions on how to use the item are clearly defined
Whether the purchased items are “fit for use” (i.e. appropriate for the task it was purchased for)
Whether an adequate supply (for at least 6 months) can be ensured

4-9 How is the amount of stock required estimated?

For smooth operation of an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) a constant supply of acceptable quality products must be ensured. In an Ebola outbreak, one will have to make certain assumptions or best guess estimates regarding the volume of usage, for example:

A 10 bedded ETU located in a high humidity and temperature country
At least 4 healthcare workers per shift
A shift is usually 4 hours, but the ETU has no ventilation/cooling systems so each healthcare worker can only comfortably work for 60 minutes in the clinical areas when in full PPE
Therefore, instead of using 4 sets of PPE per shift, the usage will be multiplied by 4 giving 16 sets of PPE per shift. One always assumes the need for extra sets of PPE (in case of damage or heavy soiling). So in fact it will require 20 sets of PPE per shift for a 10 bedded ETU. 
For each 24 hour period up to 120 sets of PPE may be needed!
Gloves and plastic aprons should also be changed between patients (so the totals required will be more than the PPE sets).

If the quality of the PPE items is poor, this estimated number required could increase further. This potentially could lead to PPE shortages, in addition to generally increasing risk of healthcare worker contamination when using PPE of poor quality.

The amount of stock needed in each Ebola Treatment Unit must be carefully calculated

4-10 What considerations are important when dealing with donated stock?

Everyone is trying to help with Ebola and making donations of equipment and materials which are not always appropriate to the local conditions. It is best to be specific about what donations are required and acceptable, otherwise large numbers of items that are unusable will be wasted. Countries in need do not want to appear ungrateful and often feel obliged to accept inappropriate donations. These items may be difficult to dispose of and may create an expectation of usefulness, but does not influence the outcome of the epidemic. Acceptable donation are disposable and/or single use items of good quality such as hand hygiene products, PPE or similar. Equally good quality linen, patient care articles and ward support articles can be accepted.

Note: For electrical machinery such as sterilizers, washer disinfectors, or other automated equipment make sure the following is also available and comes as part of the donation: What is the equipment to be used for – is it really needed? Will it reduce risk to staff, if so, how? Will the donor provide certified orientation to local staff on the use and maintenance of the donated equipment? What infrastructure is required to run the machines, such as 3 phase electricity, running water with sufficient pressure?  What are the manufacturer’s guidelines and instructions on which chemicals are to be used with these machines and will these be supplied for 5 years? (If the wrong ones are used, the machines will not function.) Will the donor sign a contract to provide regular servicing of the equipment for at least 5 years? Will there be spare parts available for at least 5 years? 

DECONTAMINATION OF EQUIPMENT 
_____________________________________________________________

4-11 What is decontamination?

Decontamination is the process followed to ensure that re-usable medical devices are safe to use on the next patient. Examples are the decontamination of a vaginal speculum between patients or surgical instruments between operations. In the case of outbreaks, particularly with viral haemorrhagic fevers, the risk of transmitting infection when sharing equipment is high (by indirect contact.)  Decontamination includes some or all of the following steps:

Cleaning
Disinfection)
Sterilization





4-12 What is cleaning?

Cleaning is the physical removal of all visible organic matter and dirt from the surfaces and crevices (hinges and serrated teeth) of any item that is to be disinfected or sterilized. Cleaning is essential before any disinfection of surfaces or disinfection and/or sterilization of equipment which is reused, whether for patient care or surgery. In order for cleaning to be effective, detergents are added to the water.




4-13 What is disinfection?

Disinfection is the use of heat or a chemical which will reduce the number of disease-producing micro-organisms (bio-burden) of an item. Disinfection will kill most bacteria, most viruses (including Ebola) and some fungi and parasites. It does not kill spores. Prior to disinfection, all items must be thoroughly cleaned as disinfectants can be inactivated by organic matter. Disinfection is used to make an item safe to handle and safe for use, but the items are not sterile. The best method of disinfection is heat because it is simple, inexpensive and can be controlled. However in the current Ebola outbreak disinfectants such as 0.05% chlorine (bleach) are widely used because of the ease of availability in shops across Africa.



4-14 Why should the indiscriminate and incorrect use of chlorine be discouraged?

Items are often soaked in chemical disinfectants such as chlorine immediately after use in the belief that the virus will be destroyed. This is incorrect for the following reasons:

Organic matter protects microbes
Soil and organic matter will stick to the surfaces and will be difficult to clean
Chemicals such as chlorine will destroy the smooth surface of the instrument and create pits and crevices which allow dirt and organic matter to remain. This makes the instrument impossible to clean in the future
Chemicals such as chlorine are inactivated by organic matter so it is ineffective

Putting items in liquid solutions also increases the risk of splashes to mucous membranes while spraying with disinfectant also increases the risk of human exposure. Chlorine must always be used with caution as it is irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. Therefore always wear protective equipment when using chlorine.






4-15 What is sterilisation?

Since little or no invasive procedures are undertaken in Ebola Treatment Units, the need to sterilize items is limited, and it might be best to use disposable packs when necessary. Nonetheless, it is important to know what should be done in case sterilization (“CSSD” or Central Sterile Services Department) is required. Sterilization means that all microbes are killed including bacterial spores. It is a process used mostly for surgical instruments (where sterility is essential). The main method of sterilization is steam (with release of heat when it is in contact with items in the sterilizer). Chemical sterilization is possible but the equipment is expensive, the exposure time is long (hours) and has to be well controlled. It also does not work with all instruments. 

Note: The Spaulding classification best defines the type of medical devices and the level of processing they require to be rendered safe for re-use.

Critical
Medical devices entering a sterile area of the body e.g. surgical instruments must be sterile. This means they must be sterilised under controlled conditions with quality indicators.
Semi-critical
Medical devices that enter areas of the body which have microbes in them such as the mouth and the respiratory tract; these items have to be clean and disinfected.
Non-critical
Items from the patient’s environment (not in direct contact with the patient) which can cause disease by indirect contact via hands. These must be clean and dry. 


Sterilisation is a process which kills all micro-organisms

4-16 Which factors increase risk of transmission from inadequately decontaminated items?

The major risks are medical devices contaminated with blood and body fluids. Devices which have been damaged (lost integrity) due to pre-soaking in corrosive disinfectants such as 0.05% chlorine (bleach) are also a risk. If devices are poorly cleaned, organic matter will remain on the instruments, preventing proper disinfection and/or sterilization. Staff must be well trained in proper reprocessing including cleaning, disinfection and sterilization. The reprocessing equipment must be functioning and the systems validated. The final risk is lack of proper storage of sterile items which become re-contaminated.

4-17 What steps should be followed when reprocessing devices?

Reprocessing is the action which makes reusable medical devices safe to use on other patients:

Step 1: Make a list (an inventory) of the available medical devices which are re-usable. 

Step 2: Evaluate the workload of the facility per week or month e.g. how many procedures of which type take place on average. Then estimate the number of medical devices needed for these procedures. It is important to ensure that the staff dealing with medical devices is trained in handling equipment from Ebola facilities. 

Step 3: Pre-soak procedure (at the site of use). Wear PPE. Place clean water and detergent in a bucket with a lid, with a sieve (rack or tray) that can fit into it. The water level should be two thirds of the height of the container. The two handles of the rack or tray are outside on the lip of the bucket. The instruments are placed on this rack. After the surgical operation, the rack is lowered into the bucket and the instruments are soaked (completely covered) for 10 minutes to remove organic matter. Lift the rack and allow the medical devices to drain. Carry out a visual inspection to ensure most of the organic matter has been removed. If not, repeat the process. Throw the water from the bucket into the sluice (or patient toilet if nothing else is available). Place the rack in the bucket with the lid secured in place and carry these instruments to the sterilisation area. Disassemble and prepare for cleaning. No bleach or any other disinfectant is needed.





Step 4: Cleaning of medical devices. This is the most essential step in disinfection and/or  sterilization. Cleaning can be done with an automatic washer or manually:
If an automated washer disinfector is available that can reaches a temperature of 90oC, use it!  This is the safest system for most pathogens including viral haemorrhagic fever viruses. Once the cycle is complete, the medical devices are clean and safe to handle. Place the rack of instruments directly into the chamber with all medical devices disassembled and the hinges in the open position and run the cycle. The process has to be validated and the cycle completed. Automated systems are ideal as they allow minimal handling of contaminated devices
Where only manual cleaning is possible wear full protective PPE such as gloves (domestic), plastic apron, face cover and head cover, rubber boots. Dilute the medical device detergent (not to be confused with domestic detergent) according to manufacturer’s guidelines. Measure the right amount of water and put a mark in the sink.  Measure the detergent and pour it into the water filled sink or basin. Put the medical devices into the sink and hold them under the water level to prevent splashing- never wash such medical devices under running water. Use a soft nylon brush such as a toothbrush and clean in the grooves, hinges and serrated ends.  Inspect to ensure the medical devices are clean. Remove carefully and lay into trays according to requirements on the checklist. Remove PPE. Wash hands thoroughly. 

Most medical devices can be reprocessed safely if this is done by trained personnel

Note: For manual cleaning refer to the WHO Decontamination Manual, 2nd Edition 2014

4-18 What additional steps should be followed when for devices that require sterilisation?

Step 5: Inspection, Assembly, Packaging. Have a close look at the instruments for cleanliness, integrity and functionality. Disassemble all devices unless the manufacturer’s recommendations are to sterilize them while assembled. Place in trays and wrap with appropriate covers if a porous load sterilizer is used.  Place on trolley and load into the sterilizer.

Step 6: Sterilization. There are either gravity (downward displacement) sterilizers or porous load (pre vacuum) sterilizers. Careful placing and loading is important to allow good removal of air and circulation of steam!

Note: Gravity Sterilizers: validation is done by checking and recording readings from the gauges and physical indicators; make sure the operators know how to use them and what the gauge readings mean. Porous Load sterilizers: these sterilizers will require 3 phase electricity and usually a constant water supply with clean water to provide high quality steam. They are more sophisticated and the operators will require training. Minimum indicators are the daily Bowie Dick test and the chemical indicator is placed inside per each pack, and ideally a biological indicator is run daily or at least weekly. There must be adequate space for steam to circulate and penetrate and that the vacuum will remove air consistently. Steam must be of the correct saturation to be most effective and penetrate each of the packs to ensure sterility.

Step 7: Sterile storage & transportation. Once the sterilization packages have been removed, they must be allowed to cool before being used. They must come out dry from the sterilizer and be kept in a cool and dry environment ready for use. Sterile packs must be transported in a clean and dry manner. Sterile or cleaned items should be stored in a clean dry area away from the heat.

DECONTAMINATION OF PATIENT CARE ARTICLES 
_____________________________________________________________

4-19 Why do patient care articles pose a hazard?

A major source of transmission between patients and staff is poorly cleaned patient care articles such as bedpans, urinals, jugs, bowls and mattresses. These articles are often neglected because they have to be cleaned manually and proper provisions often do not exist. There is high risk of Ebola transmission from faeces, urine, vomitus and patient excretions therefore it is best to assist the patient to get to the toilet. If available, adult nappies are another alternative. Cleaning is vital to reduce the transmission of Ebola. It is also the first step prior to disinfection or sterilization.

It is important to manually clean bedpans, urinals, jugs, bowls and mattresses especially if soiled by stool or vomitus

4-20 How should patient care articles be disinfected?

Automated bedpan washer disinfectors are best because these reduce the risk of exposure to the staff and also clean and disinfect the items using heat (90oC for 1 min). Where not available, manual cleaning should be done using the following method:

Wear appropriate PPE covering all exposed skin and mucous membranes to avoid contamination with splashes
Remove the used patient item and flush the contents down the patient’s toilet
Rinse off the remaining contents with water until visibly clean
Using a soft brush clean with water and detergent paying special attention to under the rim, and other difficult to reach areas
Do not scrub under running water tap, it increases risk of splashes! 
Rinse again and inspect for cleanliness
Wipe over with 0.05% chlorine and allow to dry
An alternative is to place upside down in the sun to dry, the bedpan will reach at least 85oC in the sun (enough to kill Ebola virus)
Do not soak bedpans, jugs or urinals in chlorine - it corrodes the metal and chlorine is inactivated by organic matter.

Ebola virus is highly sensitive to heat

4-21 How should clinical items be handled?

Clinical items (such as thermometers) used in the confirmed Ebola section of the ETU may not be removed to other areas. These items should be cleaned with an alcohol wipe after each use. In West Africa, blood pressure apparatus is not used because of the risk of contamination. However in high income countries, disposable blood pressure cuffs and distance monitoring disposable finger probes are used. In almost all ETUs, no invasive procedures are carried out and therefore there are very few used medical devices which will require reprocessing.

4-22 How should patient’s crockery and cutlery be handled?

In Ebola, feeding utensils such as crockery (cups and plates) and cutlery (spoons, knives and forks), can get contaminated with saliva and patient secretions and will be treated as infectious. For this reason it is often simplest to supply food to inpatients in disposable containers. However should the need arise to wash utensils (such as at home) the following method may be applied:
Wear appropriate PPE (at home domestic gloves and aprons are sufficient if PPE is not available, while covering the face with a cloth) 
Fill a basin with clean warm water and detergent, allow the items to soak for a couple of minutes. Sometimes chlorine is added to the water prior to washing. This has no additional disinfection value however it makes the carer feel safer.
Using a cleaning brush or cloth, wipe over the surfaces carefully while holding the items under water to prevent splashing. Do not wash under running water! 
Remove and drip dry. 

DECONTAMINATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
_____________________________________________________________

4-23 How should the patient environment be cleaned? 

Environmental cleaning (cleaning the area around a patient) is a crucial part of infection control in ETU and must be done with special care and attention. In situations like Ebola, where high contamination of the environment is expected, cleaning and disinfection of all surfaces, at least once a day is recommended.

The method for environmental cleaning and disinfection recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2014) is:
Wear full protective PPE (domestic gloves, gown, face cover, head cover, rubber boots)
Prepare a fresh solution of detergent in a clean bucket according to the manufacturer’s guidelines for dilution
Prepare a separate bucket of disinfectant (i.e. 1,000 parts per million of hypochlorite solution), see WHO guideline for chlorine solution preparation (appendix B). 
Use these two buckets/containers (preferably of different colour) and two sets of clean dry clothes and mops; one for water and detergent, and other for the disinfectant solution
To minimize the spread of contamination on surfaces during cleaning, always start from clean areas first, such as the ward areas, and then move towards the dirtiest area last (toilets)
Wipe the surfaces with water and detergent solution to remove organic matter and prevent inactivation of disinfectant
Apply the disinfectant to the surfaces using a cloth (rather than spraying)
Pay particular attention to frequently touched areas and horizontal surfaces
Prepare clean, freshly made-up solution when the water in the bucket is dirty
At the end of the cleaning session, discard the liquid in the buckets into the sluice (if sluice is not available, discard into the patient’s toilet)
Clean and dry the containers and stored inverted
Discard disposable clothes as an infected waste 
Disposable mop heads are preferred for high contamination areas. If the mop heads are reused they should be washed thoroughly in water and detergent, then disinfected with hypochlorite, rinsed and allow to dry before reuse.

4-24 What is terminal cleaning?

This is cleaning that is carried out when a patient is discharged or has died. The purpose of terminal cleaning is to make the room safe for the next patient to use (by reducing the chance of transmitting infection from contaminated surfaces.) In ETU the rapid patient turnover makes it impossible to do this thoroughly. All disposable items or disposable equipment which has been in contact with an Ebola patient must be discarded as infectious waste. There are usually very few (if any) reusable items to be sent for decontamination. 





4-25 How should blood and body fluid spills be handled?

The following principles should be applied:

All blood spillages should be immediately cleaned up using domestic gloves
Glass and solids should be removed using a brush and pan, and discarded in a sharps container or if too large, wrapped in newspaper before safely disposing
The remaining fluids should be blotted using as many paper towels as needed; these should be discarded in the clinical waste
Water and detergent should be used to remove all visible blood
The area should be wiped over with a chlorine-based solution (at a concentration of 1 000 parts per million) and allowed to dry
Every healthcare facility and ETU requires a written, easily understandable and accessible standard operating procedure (SOP) for managing blood and body fluid spills.

An easily understandable protocol for handling blood or body fluid spills must be displayed

4-26 How should used (soiled) linen be handled?

Linen is a potential source of Ebola transmission, particularly when contaminated with blood and body fluids. Disposable linen is ideal, but in most resource-constrained settings, linen will be re-used. When handling contaminated linen: 

Protect yourself with appropriate PPE (see table 4-7)
Remove the linen from the patient’s bed
Remove gross contamination by scraping off into the patient’s toilet or waste pit
Soak the linen in clean water and detergent for 30 minutes. Remove and inspect the linen. Rub to remove dirt. Discard the water
Make up a fresh solution of 0.05% chlorine in water (bleach) and soak the linen in it for another 30 minutes
Remove, rinse in clean water and wring out
Spread in the sun to dry
Wash the domestic gloves with soap and water before removing the PPE. Remove all the PPE safely. Carry out hand hygiene.
4-27 How should mattresses be disinfected?

While wearing full PPE, the mattress must be checked for any damage (there should be no tears or cracks). Fill a bucket with clean water and detergent. Use a cloth soaked in the bucket to wipe over the surface of the mattress. Wipe to dry. Wipe over with a disinfectant such as 0.5% chlorine solution and allow to dry (preferably in the sun).

0.05% chlorine (bleach) can be used to disinfect linen and mattresses

4-28 How should the home of a patient diagnosed with Ebola be decontaminated?

When entering a home, be respectful. Inform the senior member of the family of what you are about to do. Allow the family to tidy up the home if they want to. Put on the full set of personal protective equipment before entering the home. Go to the victim’s room to remove the body only after the prayers or other rites have been completed. Spray the home (surfaces, walls and floors) with a 0.5% chlorine solution, after thoroughly cleaning with detergent. There is no point in spraying the earth outside and no benefit in spraying humans directly with chlorine!

WASTE MANAGEMENT
_____________________________________________________________

4-29 What is medical waste?

Ebola Treatment Units and other healthcare facilities (not directly handling Ebola patients) produce a considerable amount of waste. In the case of an ETU, all waste is classified as infectious. This simplifies matters because waste no longer needs to be separated into infectious (clinical) and non-infectious waste. Make sure that the ETU or facility has a clear policy stating who is responsible for collecting the waste, where containers will be stored, and how the waste will be finally disposed of. 

4-30 How should medical waste be handled?

All areas where PPE is removed and patient care areas should have robust waste containers lined with red bags for infectious waste. If the outer containers are not disposable they have to be washed, cleaned, disinfected and relined with a red bag. During these processes the waste management worker should: 

Wear appropriate PPE
Tie the neck of the bag and lift the bag gently, ensuring it does not spill
Place it in another red bag
Tie the neck of the bag, label it as “infectious” or “Ebola”  
Place at a collection point just outside the clinical area
Remove PPE and wash hands thoroughly.

Some people recommend spraying the outside of the bags with chlorine so that the handlers feel more comfortable that contamination is reduced. Make sure the chlorine does not drip all over the floor after spraying. For transportation of infectious waste, the bags will be collected in trolleys and taken to a point where they will be finally disposed. The trolley must be cleaned and disinfected daily or after each transportation session.

4-31 How should medical waste be disposed of?

Liquid waste can be disposed of down the patient toilets or double pit latrines. In some instances special pits can be dug to allow liquid waste disposal. All solid infectious waste must be disinfected before final disposal.

There are several methods available for disposal of solid waste:

Pit fills: This method uses a large pit which is dug behind the facility. Waste is dumped into it and then covered with chlorine or soil. Both of these methods are not safe, since humans and animals have been known to scavenge at these sites. In some countries, approximately 5 cm or more of lime is applied over the waste to cover it completely to kill the virus. It is not a robust method of disposal but could be applied in rural villages.
Drum burning: The waste is filled in drums and set alight to burn. The waste is usually incompletely burnt and has a high pollution effect.
Pit burning: Currently the most common means of disposal is pit burning. This is where a large pit is dug and the waste is layered into it. A drum which is open on both sides is placed over the pit to act as a chimney or flu. The waste is ignited and burnt. This too, has problems with incomplete burning.
Incinerators have been recommended by some, but the maintenance is a challenge.
Automated systems such as autoclaving the waste before sending to land fill, and shredding and heat disinfection of waste are all techniques which are more appropriate for high income countries with good infra-structure. However, affordable autoclaving technology for African settings is in development.
For disposal of anatomical waste e.g. placentas and human parts, burial appears to be the best method at present (although this method is also not ideal, as the water table levels may rise with run-off of infected fluids). 

4-32 How should sharps be disposed of?

In an ETU the use of sharps should be kept to an absolute minimum to reduce the risk of needle stick injury. Sharps are generally in the Ebola “suspect” or triage areas where blood samples are drawn for laboratory tests. Recently, some ETUs have started using intravenous fluid replacement in the patient care areas. In such cases, it is essential that a robust sharps container is placed within arm’s length of each healthcare worker who is using sharps. The containers must be sealed and may be sprayed with chlorine before being placed in a red bag. The neck of the bag is tied and clearly labelled and taken to a place for removal.

DOCUMENTATION
_____________________________________________________________

4-33	What information should be documented?

There are many pieces of information that should be documented when containing an outbreak, but only the essential ones are mentioned here. A reasonable list of topics is as follows:
1. Ebola preparedness. How prepared is the facility or country to deal with Ebola. A questionnaire has been produced by the Infection Control Africa Network (ICAN) and the International Society of Chemotherapy (ISC) [see Resources]
2. What is the actual caseload? This is essential information which can only be gleaned from admission records and the confirmed laboratory cases. It is best to keep an electronic record at the patient arrival point (where cases are registered). There are national figures which could also be accessed via the non-governmental organisations.
3. Set up links with the community to report suspected cases of Ebola. This could happen via peer counsellors but is not easy to set up. 
4. Infection control checklist. This is a list of items that must be in place at the beginning of each day with a 36 hour stock in the clinical areas. This includes hand hygiene products, PPE, detergents and disinfectants.
5. Clinical activity audit. Behaviour of healthcare workers during clinical ward rounds to be observed by a colleague to ensure the right practices are followed including appropriate hand hygiene.
6. Putting on and taking off PPE according to the prescribed method by the WHO - audit of practice.
4-34	Who should be responsible for documentation?

Various people are responsible for collecting data at each facility or ETU. It is best if one person is identified by the facility manager who can be held responsible for gathering and disseminating the information. The infection control (IPC) teams can collect information on clinical cases and IPC practices. They can also carry out audits to help with monitoring and evaluation of the programme. The information should be discussed at the daily or weekly clinical meetings, the administration meetings and those with the Department of Health. 

INCIDENT REPORTING
_____________________________________________________________

4-35	What is incident reporting?

Any accidental exposure, occupational or otherwise, of a healthcare worker or patient should be reported immediately to the authorities. A register is set up which will record the incident. It will require laboratory testing (blood samples taken from source and victim) and the person will be put under observation for 21 days, which is taking one’s temperature twice a day. Ideally each Ebola treatment unit should have a physician appointed to deal with exposure incidents. All healthcare workers should be made aware of the risks and the requirement to report any exposure incidents.

Any accidental exposure by a healthcare worker must be reported immediately

4-36	What action should be taken following an exposure incident?

Accidental exposure to blood via a needle-stick or splash exposure will require the following immediate actions:
Wash the area with copious amounts of running water - make sure there is no chlorine in it!
Report the accident to your manager 
Record in the incident register exactly what happened and give details:
Did anyone observe the incident?
How did it happen? 
When did it happen? Date and time
 When was it reported? Date and time
What was the action taken?
Patient details- name, age, gender.  How long has the patient had symptoms of Ebola? (less infectious in the early stages)
Have blood samples taken from the patient (not necessary if known to have Ebola) and from the healthcare worker for testing. Check the healthcare worker’s hepatitis B status.
Repeat the healthcare worker’s Ebola PCR on days 7, 14 and 21.
Recorded the healthcare worker’s body temperature every 12 hours each day for 21 days.

DESIGN OF EBOLA TREATMENT UNITS

4-37 What is the preferred layout of an Ebola Treatment Unit? 

In the countries with large Ebola outbreaks, several Ebola Treatment Units (ETU’s) have been established by different non-governmental organisations; however in all ETUs the design is covered by the same principles. There is clear definition of “clean or low-risk” and “dirty or high-risk” areas. The demarcation lines are never crossed from dirty to clean i.e. there is one-way traffic from clean to dirty areas to reduce transmission and cross-contamination. Provision for hand hygiene and appropriate PPE must be available at each entry point and provision for safe removal of PPE must be clearly defined at each exit. Clinical notes and other materials will be kept outside the high-risk areas.

The demarcation lines are never crossed from dirty to clean i.e. there is one-way traffic to reduce transmission and cross-contamination. 

4-38 What is the preferred workflow for an Ebola Treatment Unit? 

The ETU, like any other healthcare facility, should be well thought-out and constructed, whether it is make-shift with tents or a solid building structure. The ETU area is divided into separate staff and patient entry and exit areas (as shown in this diagrammatic sketch from MSF below).

Area
Description of activity
1. Staff entry area
A clearly demarcated entry point for staff going into the clinical areas after putting on PPE. The area will hold enough PPE for two days for all those entering. There is a hand hygiene station. The changing area for men and women has to be clearly defined. Here the staff changes into scrubs and wear rubber boots.
2.Staff Exit area
Staff leaving the clinical area may only do so at this exit point. There will be no cross over into the entry section. Staff will remove their PPE according to the defined protocols which should be displayed on the walls. There must be at least 3 hand hygiene stations here since there will be more than one person exiting at any one time. The area will contain infectious waste containers for the PPE. There will be a bench to sit down and remove overshoes if used. 
3.Patient entry point
Patients enter here, while the relatives go and wait at the visitors’ area. A person must be present to receive the patients and talk to the relatives, take temperature and taking a preliminary history before triaging. There must be good hand hygiene facilities available at all times. 
4.Triage area
The patient will be placed here awaiting rapid diagnosis of suspected EVD. The area should be well ventilated and airy. The patients and relatives may meet over the wall separating the visitors’ area.
5. Suspect area
Suspected Ebola cases are held here until results are returned. If the patient is found to be negative for Ebola but with suspicious clinical symptoms s/he remains there and is treated for malaria and other infectious diseases. Needs good hand hygiene facilities, isolation areas or cohort areas and good toilet facilities.
6.Confirmed cases
For patients who test positive for Ebola and are transferred from the suspect area.
7.Ambulance entry
Entry of confirmed cases via ambulance – referral in from other ETU’s.

8.Mortuary
For storage of bodies and preparation for safe burials
9.Support services
Support services, stores and other health facility infra-structure areas. Waste removal, laundry and other used item removal takes place via this area.
10.Visitors’ area
Visitors’ area where they can meet their families. This area should be covered and have seating for visitors to rest. There should be hand hygiene and toilet facilities. Information posters in at least two or three languages. 
 
















4-39 What is required for water supply?

A constant supply of clean water is essential for hand hygiene, domestic use, washing of patients, food preparation and most importantly cleaning the environment. Water supply is also required for steam sterilizers, laundry and in some areas, waste disposal. Ideally large tanks should be installed to contain up to three days usage of water. Piped water to the patient areas, kitchen and laundry would be ideal.

4-40 What are the power/energy requirements?

There should be a constant supply of electricity to all healthcare facilities. If power outages are common, a generator or two (possible donation) which runs on petrol or diesel would be essential. Some of the larger equipment such as sterilizers and operating theatre systems will require 3 Phase electricity supply. If used as fuel, natural gas can either be piped or delivered in bottles or containers. It might be a cheaper alternative to electricity.

4-41 What are the ventilation requirements?

An essential but often neglected aspect of facility design is ventilation. Most of the ETU do not have any type of ventilation. By following the recommendations of high income countries and using coveralls without any ventilation in the facilities, healthcare workers have suffered from heat exhaustion and reduced capacity to work efficiently. This is cited as one of the reasons for healthcare workers getting infected, because they function less than optimally under these conditions. Good natural ventilation is important. In ideal circumstances, negative pressure ventilation of at least 6-12 air changes would be recommended. 


CASE STUDY 
______________________________________________________

A foreign country’s ministry of health has decided to assist in the West African Ebola crisis by building and staffing a 50-bed Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in Sierra Leone. They consult a team of healthcare facility design, engineers, logistics managers and infection control specialists to determine what will be needed.

1. What are the basic requirements for setting up a field hospital or Ebola Treatment Unit?

The facility will require multiple temporary structures e.g. tents to accommodate patients and support service activities. A stable water and energy supply is needed. Provision of adequate natural or mechanical ventilation should be carefully considered, given the extremely hot and humid climate. Aside from medical and nursing staff, the ETU will require a host of other, very important workers to run the support services e.g. engineers, supply managers, epidemiologists, decontamination experts etc.

2. How should the Ebola Treatment Unit be laid out?

There should be separate entrances and exits for staff and patients. Patients should be separated into 3 groups: triage (awaiting assessment); suspect cases (compatible Ebola case history but pending laboratory result) and confirmed cases. There should be no movement from the confirmed area, to other areas. There should be clear definition of “clean or low-risk” and “dirty or high-risk” areas. The demarcation lines should never be crossed from dirty to clean i.e. there is one-way traffic to reduce transmission and cross-contamination. Provision for hand hygiene and appropriate PPE must be available at each entry point and provision for safe removal of PPE must be clearly defined at each exit. 

3. Which support services should be present?

The work of the support service teams is critical to the smooth operation and safety of patients and healthcare workers in outbreak settings. They provide a safe environment in a busy and potentially highly infectious work setting. All ETU need some or all of the following support services: Procurement/Supply chain management; Engineers (ventilation, water and electricity); Decontamination services (to reprocess medical devices) and Environmental cleaning; Laundry; Waste management; Logistics and Information technology support. . 

4. How should waste be disposed of in Ebola Treatment Units?

Liquid waste can be disposed of down the patient toilets or double pit latrines. There are several methods available for disposal of solid waste e.g. pit fills, drum burning, incineration and autoclaving. All staff handling waste should be wearing full PPE and should have received full training on the risks involved.

Communication and Community Engagement

Objectives 

When you have completed this chapter you should: 

Understand the importance of clear communication during outbreaks
Know which outbreak information should be communicated
Understand why the community should be involved in outbreak management
Know how to identify and approach community leaders and structures
Understand the community’s role in Ebola outbreak education and management
Know how to communicate advice on safe burial practices for Ebola
Be familiar with technologies available for health education messaging
Be aware of the social challenges during Ebola outbreaks (stigma, orphans, trauma)

COMMUNICATION
_____________________________________________________________

5-1 Why is it important to establish clear communication with the public?

In most outbreak situations there is a degree of fear, panic and confusion among the affected community members and even among healthcare workers. With viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, like Ebola, there is great anxiety because of the associated high death rates. Clear communication from the start of the outbreak helps to reduce myths and rumours that leads to confusion and panic. Direct communication with affected communities, using contextually appropriate modes and methods, can help to correct misunderstandings about the routes of transmission and share information on preventing disease spread. It is also useful to the local authorities (government departments or ministries of health) to have regular, accurate updates and feedback from the affected communities on the situation for planning purposes.

Good communication with the public is very important for sharing accurate information to reduce panic and confusion during a disease outbreak

5-2 Who should be informed of the outbreak?

The first step in managing any outbreak is to alert all the local stakeholders e.g. department of health, laboratories, clinicians (doctors/nurses), and community leaders. A small core group of people (the outbreak team) should be formed to plan the investigation and management of the outbreak. The outbreak team may consist of a local government/ministry of health representative, a doctor, a nurse, and a field epidemiologist. Ideally one person should be nominated to act as the local spokesperson to represent the outbreak team and communicate and share important information with other stakeholders.

5-3 How should critical information be shared?

For an individual facility (e.g. an Ebola Treatment Unit) or the local district’s ministry of health, a list of key stakeholders (usually members of the outbreak team) should be drawn up. These key individuals should meet regularly (ideally daily) to discuss progress and problems encountered during the local outbreak response.  Accurate and detailed minutes of these meetings should be kept to allow for reporting and to draw up lists of further actions required for outbreak management. In the event of large and/or multi-country outbreaks (as in the current Ebola outbreak), all the locally-collected data on disease cases, contacts and deaths, may also need to be shared with other organisations involved in outbreak management e.g. WHO (the World Health Organisation).

PREPARING FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
_____________________________________________________________

5-4	 Why should the community be involved in outbreak management?

It is absolutely essential to involve the affected communities as soon as possible after confirmation of the outbreak. By working together with community leaders and members, the outbreak team can achieve several aims:

Address myths and rumours
Reduce confusion and panic 
Increase the community’s level of trust in healthcare workers
Provide information on disease symptoms and signs, and encourage affected individuals to seek care
Communicate important messages about disease prevention e.g. safe burials
Identify and use community resources to assist with outbreak management
Learning from the community about their local conditions, concerns and contributions. 

5-5	Who from the community should be involved?

Most communities have formal or informal leadership structures in place. This will vary from place to place but may include multiple individuals or organisations such as:

Tribal or traditional leaders
Religious or faith-based leaders
Respected and trusted informal leaders such as elders, popular school teachers or a youth group
Government or political leaders
Non-governmental or charity organisations
It may be difficult for an outsider to identify community leaders. By asking a representative number of community members to name their local “leaders” it usually becomes clear which individuals or organisations are respected and trusted in the area. If not, a few simple questions can help, such as, “Who do people here go to for advice?” and “When this community has had a problem in the past, which people have helped address it?” or “Who gets things done?” 

IMPLEMENTING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
_____________________________________________________________

5-6	How should community leaders be approached when requesting their assistance?

The most senior member/s of the outbreak team (preferably a local person, who speaks the language of the area) should approach the community leader/s for help. Local customs for engaging with community leaders should be respected. In some cultures, a small gift (e.g. food) may be customary when visiting local leaders, while in others this may be considered offensive.   The outbreak team should aim to convey some key messages and obtain advice from the community leader/s:

Ask about the community members’ understanding of the disease
Find out if there are any rumours or misconceptions about the disease or outbreak
Provide explanations or information to clarify any misconceptions
Ask the community leader/s how they feel the outbreak team can help
Ask the community leader/s how the community can be involved
Explain the cause of the outbreak (if known)
Explain how the disease is transmitted
Discuss risk factors at community level and how these could be reduced to prevent exposure to and transmission of infection
Explain how the outbreak should be managed, including safe burial procedures
Ask the community leader/s to identify the most appropriate modes and methods for health communication to and from the community
Suggest ways in which the community and the healthcare/outbreak team can work together to prevent further transmission and manage the outbreak
Invite a leader, trusted and respected by the affected community, to join the outbreak team as a community liaison.

5-7	What types of activities should communities be involved with?

Once the community leader/s have agreed to assist, they could potentially help with many outbreak management activities:

Educate the community about what Ebola is, risk factors and how it spreads
Communicate important messages about disease prevention e.g. safe burials and regular hand washing
Encourage and provide places for hand washing
Educate their community about disease symptoms and signs
Encourage  individuals with Ebola symptoms to seek care immediately
Support and report sick individuals or families to the local health authorities, to provide care, dispatch ambulances and/or do contact tracing (some areas have free “hotline” numbers that the community can use to report Ebola cases)
Support and reduce stigma against survivors, affected families or children orphaned by Ebola.

5-8	Why are these activities more likely to be successful if communities are involved?

Early involvement with integration of the knowledge of the affected community builds trust in the outbreak team. It also provides community leaders and residents  with a sense of “ownership” of both the problem and the solution (i.e. by being actively involved in preventing and reducing spread of the disease.) In many cases, community members are also more likely to understand and accept disease prevention methods (e.g. safe burials) if the recommendation comes from a respected local leader.

5-9	How should important health messages be conveyed to communities?

Aside from using local leadership structures and word of mouth, the following mediums should be considered to share important health messages regarding the outbreak:

Local radio stations, television programmes and newspapers
Mass gatherings e.g. church services
Billboards and posters (particularly in densely populated urban areas and at ports of entry/exit e.g. airports, harbours, train and bus stations)
Mass cellular messaging services to all cellphones in the affected area (using short “text messages” or “SMS”.)

All available forms of media should be used to share important health messages

5-10 What should communities be told regarding safe burials for Ebola victims?

Traditional burial practices in some west African countries involve washing and touching of the corpse by family members and people attending the burial. This traditional practice has been linked with many cases of Ebola transmission and is thought to play a major role in spreading Ebola. In order to avoid this risk, healthcare workers and ministries of health are trying to encourage communities to practice so-called “safe burials”. This concept is at odds with social and cultural rituals, and so the procedure should be clearly explained to the community and affected family members, by the community leader/s with reinforcement by health promoters and other community health workers. 

The following key messages should be communicated (through multiple channels) regarding suspected or confirmed Ebola deaths:

The body of a person who has died from (possible) Ebola should not be touched, washed or buried by family/community members
The family/community should report the death to the local health authorities for investigation and to collect the body for safe burial
It is necessary to disinfect the house and screen family members for disease after someone has died from (possible) Ebola
Family members should be encouraged to participate in the safe burial process, through preparation of a coffin, grave site, funeral attendance and performing traditional burial rites (dance, songs) at the funeral.

CHALLENGES OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
_____________________________________________________________

5-11 Which challenges should be anticipated with community engagement?

The main challenges of community involvement may include:

Gaining the trust of the affected community and its leadership
Identifying the correct leader/s to approach and to avoid conflict between different leaders or structures
Ensuring that they are approached respectfully and not in a patronising way
Trying, as far as possible, to respect and incorporate local customs when making recommendations (particularly relevant to Ebola and burial rites)
Quickly dispelling rumours about the outbreak by sharing information with the community regularly.

5-12	How can the stigma of Ebola virus disease be reduced?

For diseases like Ebola, there is serious stigmatisation of individuals and families infected or affected by Ebola. Ebola survivors returning to their communities may be shunned or even chased away by community members, who do not understand disease transmission. On discharge, Ebola survivors should be accompanied home by a healthcare worker (or community health worker/health promoter) to explain to the family/community that they are no longer infectious. It is often helpful for the community to witness the healthcare worker shaking hands or hugging the survivor, and even for the survivor to be given a certificate stating they are cured. Most Ebola survivors will need ongoing care and support in the weeks following discharge to ensure food security, provide psychological support and establish successful re-integration into the community.  In some cases, Ebola survivors have been recruited to help with:

Ebola contact tracing in communities
Care of Ebola-orphans
Provision of home-based care to individuals with Ebola
Assistance at Ebola Treatment Units (as they are “immune” to re-infection, although the duration of this protection in not known.)

CASE STUDY 
______________________________________________________

A small rural village in Guinea has been affected by the Ebola outbreak, with several community members reportedly becoming infected and dying after participating in the traditional burial rites for a person who died from Ebola. The nearby Ebola Treatment Unit sends an outbreak team to investigate the deaths and meet with community leaders.

1. Who should be part of the outbreak team sent to the village?

The outbreak team may consist of a local government/ministry of health representative, a doctor, a nurse, and a field epidemiologist. The most senior member/s of the outbreak team (preferably a local person, who speaks the language of the area) should approach the community leader/s for help.

2. What should the outbreak team consider when entering the village?

They should find out from local community members who the main respected and trusted “leaders” are in the village. They should check if there are local customs for engaging with community leaders. In some cultures, a small gift (e.g. food) may be customary when visiting local leaders, while in others this may be considered offensive.  The outbreak team should approach the village leader/s humbly and respectfully, and be willing both to share and receive advice on how best to deal with the outbreak. They should be prepared to discuss and dispel rumours about the outbreak by sharing information about the outbreak with the community honestly and often.

3. What should be the aims of the outbreak team’s visit to the village leader/s? 

The outbreak team should aim to convey some key messages and obtain advice from the community leader/s regarding:

The community members’ understanding of the disease
