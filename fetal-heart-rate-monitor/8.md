### 56. What is the management of a woman with decelerations? 

First the relation of the decelerations to the uterine contractions must be observed to determine the type of deceleration. Then manage the woman as follows: 

If the decelerations are early, the fetal heart rate pattern warns that there is an increased risk of fetal distress and, therefore, the fetal heart rate must be checked every 15 minutes. If possible monitor the fetal heart continuously with a CTG. The condition of the mother and the progress of labour must also be regularly assessed. 

If repeated late decelerations are present, manage for fetal distress.
