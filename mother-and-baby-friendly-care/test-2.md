# Test 2: Mother friendly care during labour, delivery and the puerperium

1.	Can a woman play an active part in her labour and delivery?
	+	Yes. She should be encouraged to play an active role.
	-	Only if she is multigravida and has experienced a vaginal delivery before.

	-	No. Most women do not have the knowledge or training to play an active role in their labour and delivery care.
2.	Should women routinely receive an enema during labour?
	-	Yes, as it speeds up the first stage of labour.
	-	Yes, as it avoids the passage of stool with the delivery.
	-	No, as it increases the risk of meconium stained liquor.
	+	No, as there is no scientific evidence that it has any benefit.
3.	What are the advantages of shaving women during labour?
	-	It decreases the risk of infection if the perineum tears.
	-	It decreases the risk of infection if an episiotomy is done.
	-	It is part of good training and practice.
	+	There are no advantages and routine shaving should be stopped.
4.	Should women be allowed to shower or bath during labour?
	-	No as it increases the risk of infection.
	-	No as the fetus may drown before it is born.

	+	Most mothers may walk around during labour.
8.	Do women need a labour companion?
	+	Most women would benefit from a labour companion.
	-	Only primiparous women need have a labour companion.
	-	A labour companion is sometimes needed but this is impractical as they get in the way and interfere with the work of the midwives and doctors.
	-	They are not needed as midwives can look after women in labour.

	-	Only in high risk labour.

11.	Should routine early rupture of the membranes be encouraged?
	-	Yes as it speeds up labour.
	-	Only if the fetal head has not yet engaged.
	-	Only in women who are HIV positive.
	+	No as there are no proven advantages.
12.	What is a ‘natural childbirth’?
	-	A vaginal delivery.
	+	A delivery with minimal medical interference so that the woman has as much control as possible over her delivery.
	-	A delivery following the spontaneous onset of labour.
	-	A delivery at home with the family present.
13.	Is it better if a doctor delivers all infants?
	-	Yes as they have had the most training.
	-	Yes as this will lower the Caesarean section rate.
	+	No as midwives can very competently deliver most infants.
	-	No as doctors in many poor countries are only allowed to perform instrument deliveries and Caesarean sections.
14.	Can women be safely delivered at home?
	-	This is a dangerous practice and must be discouraged.
	-	Home delivery is safe if the delivery is performed by a doctor.
	+	Home delivery is safe if women are carefully selected and the home circumstances are adequate.
