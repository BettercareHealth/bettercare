<h1 id="planning-a-group">Planning a group</h1>

<h2 id="group-meeting-times">Group meeting times</h2>

<p>The first thing you need to decide on once you have formed a group is what time the group will meet. Group sessions should be at regular intervals so members can plan for them often enough to keep participants focused and on track. We recommend once a week or once every two weeks. </p>

<p>Although groups need to be regular, you should be flexible. People’s work schedules may change, or they may have other commitments that come up. You should find a way to communicate with all group members about changing times and venues. SMS messages are a convenient way to do this, so make sure you have everyone’s cellphone numbers. </p>

<p>Remember the group should decide together on a meeting time that suits everyone and fits into your work schedule. If you have 10 or more people wanting to do the course, you can split the group in two and have two different meeting times (e.g. a morning group and an afternoon group). </p>

<p>You will also need to get permission from the authorities at your institution if the group meeting time is during working hours. </p>

<h2 id="identifying-resources-and-material">Identifying resources and material</h2>

<p>Some of the books include skills workshops. These work best if you have someone to demonstrate the skill to the group. There should also be an opportunity for the group members to practise the skill at the group meeting. </p>

<p>The first step is to identify a person who has that particular skill and is willing to demonstrate the skill. This could be an experienced co-worker, a visiting mentor or someone from a different job category. It is more convenient if the person is from the same institution as yourself, but if that is not possible, you can invite someone from a nearby health facility. When you invite someone, you need to be clear about what they have to do. Give them a copy of the skills workshop they will be covering, and remember to give them clear information about the time and place of the meeting, preferably in writing. If you like, you can give the demonstrator a small gift to show your appreciation. A card signed by the members of the group is meaningful and doesn’t cost a lot of money.</p>

<p>Often the skills workshops require equipment or other resources for the demonstration (e.g. medical equipment, a dummy or medical charts). Make a list of these requirements in advance and make a plan to ensure you have all the necessary resources for a successful workshop. You can delegate this task to someone in the group. Group members can take turns to get the resources together for the skills workshop. </p>

<h2 id="a-training-budget">A training budget</h2>

<p>If you have to buy books for the group members, you will need to make a budget. Some hospitals and clinics will pay for learning materials for their staff, but you need to give them a clear budget for how much the materials will cost and any other costs you might have. If you need a formal quote for books, please contact us at info@bettercare.co.za or call us at 076 657 0353, and we will give you a formal estimate. If the participants have to buy their own books, you can give them information about how much the books will cost, collect the money and order and pay for the books at once.</p>

<p>You might have other costs besides the books. If you want to have refreshments at your meetings, you need to put this in your budget and collect money from the members of the group. You can delegate the task of buying the refreshments to members of the group. If you want to give the resource people you invite small gifts or if you need to pay for their transport, this also needs to be in the budget. </p>

<p>When managing a budget, it’s a good idea to have someone other than yourself handling the finances. The group can choose someone trustworthy in the group to manage money and the training budget. Group finances should be transparent. Everyone in the group should know how much money is in the budget and how it is being spent. Keep till slips, invoices and a record of all expenses. </p>
