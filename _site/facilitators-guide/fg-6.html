<h1 id="finishing-off">Finishing off</h1>

<h2 id="completing-the-course-with-an-exam">Completing the course with an exam</h2>

<p>When your group has worked through the entire book, they can take a formal 75-question multiple-choice examination. These exams are managed by the Perinatal Education Programme. The exam questions are taken from the multiple-choice tests in the book. The content of the skills workshops and notes will not be included in the examination.</p>

<p>You will need to arrange a venue for the exam and an exam manager (an invigilator). The time needed for the exam is one hour. </p>

<p>Participants can also take the exam on their own on a “trust” basis, but it is better to have a more formal, supervised exam. </p>

<h3 id="how-to-request-exams">How to request exams</h3>

<p>Exam papers can be requested from exams@bettercare.co.za. The exam paper and answer sheet will be emailed to the exam coordinator. </p>

<p>Give clear information about which course exam you require. It’s best to request the exam paper at least two weeks before you are due to write the exam. </p>

<h3 id="marking-completed-exams">Marking completed exams</h3>

<p>The correct answer sheet will be emailed to the exam coordinator. The exam coordinator should keep the answer sheet in a safe place until the participants have completed the exam. Mark the exams immediately and give the participants their results. Please destroy the list of correct exam answers.</p>

<h3 id="getting-certificates-for-completed-exams">Getting certificates for completed exams</h3>

<p>Once you have written the exam, the exam paper and results need to be sent back. We will email the certificates as PDF documents. The group facilitator can then print them out for the participants. </p>

<p>Please contact exams@bettercare.co.za when you are ready to take the exam or if you require more information.</p>

<h3 id="pass-mark">Pass mark</h3>

<p>Participants need to achieve at least 80% in the exam to successfully complete the course. Successful candidates will be emailed or posted a certificate which states that they have successfully completed that course. </p>

<h3 id="cpd-points">CPD points</h3>

<p>Certain courses also offer CPD points for doctors. The following courses offer CPD points:</p>

<p>Maternal Care: 7 CPD points at level 2i<br />
Newborn Care: 7 CPD points at level 2i<br />
Perinatal HIV: 7 CPD points at level 2i<br />
Primary Newborn Care: 7 CPD points at level 2i<br />
Saving Mothers and Babies: 7 CPD points at level 2i<br />
Intrapartum Care: 7 CPD points at level 2i<br />
Mother and Baby Friendly Care: 7 CPD points at level 2i<br />
Primary Maternal Care: 7 CPD points at level 2i<br />
Birth Defects: 7 CPD points at level 2i   </p>

<p>Please contact the Perinatal Education Programme for more information about CPD points. </p>

<h2 id="arranging-a-certificate-handover-ceremony">Arranging a certificate-handover ceremony</h2>

<p>Once your group has completed the course and has passed the exam, you may want to have a certificate-handover ceremony to honour the graduates. This will help to reward those who have put in many hours of hard work, and to motivate other members of staff to continue their education. </p>

<p>You will probably need to arrange for snacks and guests. You can print out the certificates that the group members received when they passed the exams, and have an official handover ceremony. The ceremony doesn’t have to be fancy or time-consuming – a simple handover and public acknowledgement during a morning or lunch break should be fine.</p>

<h2 id="photographs">Photographs</h2>

<p>We would love to feature photographs of your groups on our website – you can send photos of your group during your weekly sessions, while doing skills workshops, or at the certificate-handover ceremony that you may have, and we will add them to our website. Please email photographs with captions to info@bettercare.co.za, with your name and contact phone number. </p>

<h2 id="updating-the-course-material">Updating the course material</h2>

<p>Bettercare learning materials are regularly updated to keep up with developments and changes in healthcare. Feedback from participants helps us to continuously improve our learning material. You can help by letting us know about factual or language errors, sections that are difficult to understand, and by suggesting additions or improvements to the contents. Please send any comments or suggestions to info@bettercare.co.za.</p>
