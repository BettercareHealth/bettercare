<h2 id="identifying-a-need">Identifying a need</h2>

<p>If you are reading this guide, you have already identified a need in your clinic or hospital. A need stems from a problem or a gap that needs to be filled. It is important to know more about that gap, and whether training will help to fill it, or if some other intervention is necessary. You also need to decide which learning areas need attention the most. Here are five steps to identifying training needs.</p>

<h3 id="identify-the-job-expectations">Identify the job expectations</h3>

<p>You can get this information from the employee job description, by observing what staff have to deal with on a day-to-day basis, or by asking staff what they are required to do.</p>

<h3 id="compare-employee-performance-with-job-expectations">Compare employee performance with job expectations</h3>

<p>Are staff able to do what is required of them? If they are not doing what is required of them, is the problem that they do not know how? Is the problem that they do not have time? Is the problem that they do not want to? Is the problem that they do not have the right equipment or resources? Often, there are many reasons for a performance gap and the solution needs to take all of these factors into account. Training on its own can be a solution, but it can also be only part of the solution.</p>

<h3 id="hold-a-meeting-to-discuss-training-needs">Hold a meeting to discuss training needs</h3>

<p>Invite staff to a meeting. Ask each person to bring a list of their top 5 training needs. Talk about everyone’s lists and your own observations.</p>

<h3 id="put-training-needs-into-groups">Put training needs into groups</h3>

<p>Put the training needs identified in the meeting into categories. For example, HIV/Aids care and management, maternal care etc.</p>

<h3 id="prioritise-training-needs">Prioritise training needs</h3>

<p>With the group, decide which training needs are the most urgent. For example, if you have many HIV positive patients it makes sense that training on their care and management is a priority.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-an-appropriate-course">Choosing an appropriate course</h2>

<p>After you have identified a need, you need to choose a course that meets that need. It is important to make sure that the course covers the essential knowledge and clinical skills required for your particular work setting.</p>

<p>You also need to decide which health workers will benefit from the course e.g. registered nurses, enrolled nurses, doctors, etc.</p>

<p>Look through the books or the catalogue. Compare the needs you identified to the learning material you have available or can get. Which course meets the needs you identified?</p>

<p>From here, you can make a training schedule to show which courses are most important and should be done first and which can wait until later.</p>

<h2 id="getting-stakeholder-buy-in">Getting stakeholder buy-in</h2>

<p>A stakeholder can be anyone who affects or uses a service. At a hospital or clinic, the stakeholders would be the community (who use the service), the hospital management (who set policies and manage finances), the staff (who provide the service), and the local or provincial government (who fund the service).</p>

<p>You need to make sure you have the support of these people to successfully implement your training programme (e.g. getting permission for time off from work for group sessions or for finances to buy books and pay for the exam).</p>

<p>To do that, you must clearly describe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what the training need is</li>
  <li>how the training programme will meet the need</li>
  <li>the logistics (e.g. time off, a room to meet in)</li>
  <li>what you need from the stakeholder (e.g. finances, permission, help with logistics)</li>
  <li>the costs involved (e.g. to buy learning materials and pay for the exams).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have identified the training need well, can make a good argument for why training is important, and have the support of staff and the community, you should not have too much trouble getting buy-in from your stakeholders.</p>

<h2 id="advertising">Advertising</h2>

<p>The next step is getting people to join a learning group. There are many ways of doing this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>word of mouth</li>
  <li>putting up posters inviting people to join the group</li>
  <li>handing out flyers at your facility</li>
  <li>inviting people face-to-face.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is best that you invite people to a preliminary meeting where you discuss what the training involves, where it will take place and any costs involved (e.g. do group members have to buy their own books). That way, people know what they are getting into before they commit themselves to the group. It would be helpful if at this meeting you describe what group learning is about and emphasise that each group member takes responsibility for their own learning.</p>

<h2 id="participant-requirements">Participant requirements</h2>

<p>It is also important at your first meeting that you stress any requirements you have for participants. These requirements can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>job category (e.g. enrolled nurse, registered nurse, CHW, medical officer etc.)</li>
  <li>prior experience</li>
  <li>current responsibilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some courses are better suited to some job categories than to others. Participants can be any health professional, currently employed or not.</p>

<h2 id="the-make-up-of-groups">The make-up of groups</h2>

<p>A uniform group is a group where the members have the same or similar job categories, job descriptions, responsibilities and experience. A mixed group is the opposite: members do not have the same job categories, job descriptions, responsibilities and experience. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. In a uniform group, members will understand and be able to relate to each other more easily. In a mixed group, members will be able to share their different experiences, knowledge and skills. </p>

<p>It is advisable that in these courses, the groups are at least partly uniform. Staff from other job categories can be brought in to share their knowledge, skills and experience as needed.</p>

<h2 id="group-size">Group size</h2>

<p>Collaborative learning works best in small groups of 5 to 10 members. This gives every member the opportunity to contribute to the group and share their knowledge, skills and experience with the rest of the group. It also allows group members to get to know each other better, encourage each other in the group and support each other in the workplace. Collaborative learning is based on sharing, discussion and teamwork, and this happens more easily in smaller groups.</p>

<h2 id="group-location">Group location</h2>

<p>It is easier to form a group of participants in the same institution. Group members don’t have to travel to get to the groups. Group members can also support each other and share their new skills and knowledge with their fellow group members on the job.</p>

<p>If your institution is small and there are not many people in the same job category, you might have to invite people from other clinics or hospitals nearby. The advantage is that they will have different experiences and this can stimulate discussion and help to understand the topic more deeply.</p>

<p>To run the group, you will need to find a venue that everyone can reach easily. You could book one of the staffrooms or offices at your workplace for the group sessions if groups are going to be during work hours or directly before or after work hours. Make sure it has enough seating for the members of the group and enough light and fresh air. You could get permission to put posters and charts on the walls to make the space more interesting.</p>

<p>If your group sessions are after hours, you could meet in a group member’s home. Group members could take turns to host the sessions in their homes. If possible, you could have a roster for providing refreshments (e.g. tea, coffee, biscuits) for the group.</p>
