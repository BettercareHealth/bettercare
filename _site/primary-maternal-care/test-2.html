<h1 id="test-2-assessment-of-fetal-growth-and-condition-during-pregnancy">Test 2: Assessment of fetal growth and condition during pregnancy</h1>

<ol>
  <li>What is normal fetal growth?
    <ol>
      <li>Will be present if a patient gains weight during pregnancy.</li>
      <li>The fetal weight is within the expected range of the duration of the pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Can only be accurately assessed by regular ultrasound assessment.</li>
      <li>Will be present if the amount of liquor is normal.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following maternal factors can cause intra-uterine growth restriction?
    <ol>
      <li>Tobacco smoking.</li>
      <li>Alcohol intake.</li>
      <li>Pre-eclampsia.</li>
      <li>All of the above.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following statements about intra-uterine growth restriction is correct?
    <ol>
      <li>The cause of severe intra-uterine growth restriction is usually unknown.</li>
      <li>Both maternal and fetal factors may cause intra-uterine growth restriction.</li>
      <li>Primary placental insufficiency is a common cause of intra-uterine growth restriction.</li>
      <li>Poor maternal weight gain during pregnancy is of great value in the diagnosis of intra-uterine growth restriction.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following is the best clinical method of determining uterine growth between 18 and 36 weeks of pregnancy?
    <ol>
      <li>An abdominal examination.</li>
      <li>The distance in centimetres between the upper edge of the symphsyis pubis and the fundus of the uterus.</li>
      <li>Recording the fetal heart rate at each antenatal visit.</li>
      <li>The abdominal circumference measured with a tape at each antenatal visit.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The ability to detect abnormalities in symphysis-fundus growth is improved if:
    <ol>
      <li>More persons are involved in assessing patients at antenatal visits.</li>
      <li>Patients are also weighed at each antenatal visit.</li>
      <li>The same person sees the patient at every antenatal visit.</li>
      <li>Ultrasound examinations are done at every second visit.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following symphysis-fundus height measurements is used to screen for intra-uterine growth restriction?
    <ol>
      <li>A slowing of the symphysis-fundus growth until two measurements are below the 10th centile.</li>
      <li>A slowing of the symphysis-fundus growth until one measurement is below the 10th centile.</li>
      <li>Two measurements the same irrespective of their positions on the centile lines.</li>
      <li>A measurement that is less than that recorded two visits before and falls below the 10th centile.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>With severe intra-uterine growth restriction, the difference between the gestational age and the symphysis-fundus height measurement is:
    <ol>
      <li>2 weeks or more.</li>
      <li>3 weeks or more.</li>
      <li>4 weeks or more.</li>
      <li>5 weeks or more.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Does descent of the presenting part affect your interpretation of the symphysis-fundus growth?
    <ol>
      <li>Yes, after 36 weeks with progressively less fetal head palpable above the pelvic inlet the criteria to diagnose intra-uterine restriction will no longer be valid.</li>
      <li>No, the curve is designed to take descent of the presenting part into account.</li>
      <li>No, as it is no longer necessary to palpate the amount of fetal head palpable above the pelvic inlet once it has been established that it is not a breech presentation at 34 weeks.</li>
      <li>No, as palpation of the amount of fetal head above the pelvic inlet is inaccurate.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What action is required if the symphysis-fundus height measurement at a gestational age of 30 weeks suggests intra-uterine growth restriction?
    <ol>
      <li>Patients who smoke should stop smoking.</li>
      <li>Give advice about a high-energy diet and if necessary food parcels.</li>
      <li>Careful attention must be given to counting fetal movements.</li>
      <li>All of the above.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If the symphysis-fundus measurement suggests intra-uterine growth restriction at 32 weeks gestation, what is the correct management?
    <ol>
      <li>A vaginal examination must be done to determine whether the patient’s cervix is favourable for an induction.</li>
      <li>The patient must return to the antenatal clinic at 36 weeks.</li>
      <li>Fetal heart rate monitoring must be done at each antenatal visit.</li>
      <li>The patient must be transferred to a level 2 hospital for a Doppler umbilical artery blood flow measurement.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What should be done if measures to improve symphysis-fundus growth were unsuccessful?
    <ol>
      <li>Nothing as the fetus is small but healthy.</li>
      <li>With moderate intra-uterine growth restriction and good fetal movements delivery at 38 weeks should be considered.</li>
      <li>The patient can continue to smoke and no further action is required.</li>
      <li>Pre-eclampsia can be excluded as intra-uterine growth restriction and pre-eclampsia never occur together.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The fetal condition can best be determined during the antenatal period by:
    <ol>
      <li>Weighing the patient at every antenatal visit.</li>
      <li>Measuring the patient’s blood pressure.</li>
      <li>Counting the fetal heart rate.</li>
      <li>Counting fetal movements.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>During the antenatal period it is essential to determine the fetal condition from:
    <ol>
      <li>36 weeks.</li>
      <li>34 weeks.</li>
      <li>28 weeks.</li>
      <li>24 weeks.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following statements about fetal movements is correct?
    <ol>
      <li>The date when fetal movements are first felt is a good indication of the gestational age.</li>
      <li>Good fetal movements do not necessarily indicate fetal wellbeing.</li>
      <li>All patients should be told about the importance of fetal movements.</li>
      <li>A decrease in fetal movements always indicates that the fetus is distressed.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which patients should use a fetal movement chart?
    <ol>
      <li>All patients where there is reason to be worried about the fetal condition.</li>
      <li>All primigravidas.</li>
      <li>All pregnant patients from 28 weeks gestation.</li>
      <li>All patients who have had a previous caesarean section.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>When during the day would you advise a patient to count fetal movements?
    <ol>
      <li>Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day after breakfast.</li>
      <li>Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day before breakfast.</li>
      <li>Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day after lunch.</li>
      <li>Fetal movement should be counted and recorded for a period of an hour per day after supper.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>How would you advise a patient to count fetal movements?
    <ol>
      <li>She should preferably do it together with other work as physical activity stimulates the fetus to move.</li>
      <li>She should preferably do it while resting on her side.</li>
      <li>She should preferably do it while lying flat on her back.</li>
      <li>While commuting to work in a taxi.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>When will you be worried that a patient may have a decreased number of fetal movements?
    <ol>
      <li>15–20 movements per hour.</li>
      <li>10–15 movements per hour.</li>
      <li>5–10 movements per hour.</li>
      <li>Half as many fetal movements as previously counted.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What would you advise if a patient felt only a few fetal movements during an hour?
    <ol>
      <li>The patient must go to her nearest clinic immediately and report that her fetus is only moving a little.</li>
      <li>The patient should lie on her side for a further hour and count the fetal movements.</li>
      <li>The patient should repeat the fetal movement count in the afternoon.</li>
      <li>Antenatal fetal heart rate monitoring is indicated and, therefore, she must report to her nearest hospital.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What management would be correct if a patient with reduced fetal movements presents at a hospital that does not have a cardiotocograph (CTG machine)?
    <ol>
      <li>The responsible doctor must see the patient immediately as a caesarean section should be done.</li>
      <li>Refer the patient urgently to a hospital that has a cardiotocograph.</li>
      <li>Exclude the possibility of fetal death by listening for the fetal heart with a stethoscope.</li>
      <li>Fetal movements must be counted again the next day.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
