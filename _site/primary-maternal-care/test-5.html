<h1 id="test-5-preterm-labour-and-preterm-rupture-of-the-membranes">Test 5: Preterm labour and preterm rupture of the membranes</h1>

<ol>
  <li>What is the definition of preterm labour?
    <ol>
      <li>Labour starting one hour or more after rupture of the membranes.</li>
      <li>Labour starting before 40 weeks of gestation.</li>
      <li>Labour starting before 37 weeks of gestation.</li>
      <li>Labour starting when the fetus is assessed as weighing less than 2000 g, when the gestational age is unknown.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Preterm rupture of the membranes is defined as:
    <ol>
      <li>Membranes that have ruptured at term, and not been followed by the onset of labour within 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Membranes that rupture before the second stage of labour.</li>
      <li>Membranes that have ruptured before 37 weeks of gestation, in the absence of contractions.</li>
      <li>Membranes that have ruptured before the onset of labour at any gestational age.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Preterm labour is important because it commonly results in death of the infant due to:
    <ol>
      <li>Abruptio placentae.</li>
      <li>Birth trauma.</li>
      <li>Jaundice.</li>
      <li>Hyaline membrane disease.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Chorioamnionitis is usually caused by:
    <ol>
      <li>Bacteria which cross the placenta from the maternal circulation to the fetus.</li>
      <li>Bacteria which spread from the cervix and vagina.</li>
      <li>Viral infection of the genitalia.</li>
      <li>Candida vaginitis.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Choose the correct statement regarding chorioamnionitis:
    <ol>
      <li>It causes all cases of preterm labour.</li>
      <li>It always follows preterm rupture of the membranes.</li>
      <li>It may cause and complicate preterm rupture of the membranes.</li>
      <li>It only occurs in patients with vaginitis.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Subclinical chorioamnionitis usually results in:
    <ol>
      <li>No signs or symptoms in the mother or fetus.</li>
      <li>Maternal pyrexia and tachycardia.</li>
      <li>An offensive vaginal discharge.</li>
      <li>Abdominal tenderness.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Clinical chorioamnionitis may present with:
    <ol>
      <li>Headache and backache.</li>
      <li>Vaginal bleeding.</li>
      <li>Fetal tachycardia.</li>
      <li>Dysuria and frequency.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Antibiotics should be given to:
    <ol>
      <li>All patients with preterm rupture of the membranes.</li>
      <li>All infants with preterm labour.</li>
      <li>Patients with clinical signs of chorioamnionitis.</li>
      <li>Patients with ruptured membranes, where the pregnancy is allowed to continue.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following commonly causes preterm labour?
    <ol>
      <li>Multiple pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Excessive weight gain during pregnancy.</li>
      <li>A breech presentation.</li>
      <li>No sexual intercourse in the second half of pregnancy.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which patients are at the highest risk of preterm labour?
    <ol>
      <li>Patients who book early in pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Multigravidas.</li>
      <li>Patients with a history of preterm labour in a previous pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Patients living in low socio-economic circumstances.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Women at increased risk of preterm labour should:
    <ol>
      <li>Increase their normal amount of exercise.</li>
      <li>Not take baths.</li>
      <li>Not be examined vaginally at the antenatal clinics.</li>
      <li>Avoid coitus during the second half of their pregnancies.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Braxton Hicks contractions:
    <ol>
      <li>Are sometimes uncomfortable but are not painful.</li>
      <li>Are regular.</li>
      <li>Are associated with cervical dilatation.</li>
      <li>Increase in duration and frequency.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Preterm labour is present when:
    <ol>
      <li>A patient experiences painful contractions prior to 37 weeks.</li>
      <li>Regular uterine contractions, palpable on abdominal examination prior to 37 weeks is present.</li>
      <li>Regular uterine contractions, palpable on abdominal examination and cervical effacement and/or dilatation on vaginal examination prior to 37 weeks.</li>
      <li>A patient has a history of rupture of the membranes prior to 37 weeks irrespective of whether or not she has uterine contractions.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Patients with preterm rupture of the membranes should have:
    <ol>
      <li>A digital vaginal examination to assess the state of the cervix.</li>
      <li>A sterile speculum examination only.</li>
      <li>No vaginal examination at all.</li>
      <li>Only a rectal examination.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The pH of amniotic fluid is:
    <ol>
      <li>Acid.</li>
      <li>Neutral.</li>
      <li>Alkaline.</li>
      <li>Variable.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>How should a patient with preterm labour at a gestational age of 36 weeks be managed?
    <ol>
      <li>The patient should be delivered in a MOU or district hospital.</li>
      <li>The patient should be delivered in a level 1 facility.</li>
      <li>The patient should be referred to a level 2 facility for delivery.</li>
      <li>Preterm labour should be suppressed and the patient transferred to a level 1 facility for further suppression of preterm labour.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What should be done if preterm labour has been diagnosed at a primary care antenatal clinic and the patient is less than 34 weeks pregnant?
    <ol>
      <li>Contractions need to be suppressed and the patient referred urgently to a level 2 hospital.</li>
      <li>Contractions need to be suppressed and the patient referred urgently to a level 1 hospital.</li>
      <li>There is no time to suppress contractions as this will only delay the urgent transfer of the patient.</li>
      <li>If the cervix is less than 2 cm dilated it is better to wait to see if further dilatation occurs before transfer is arranged.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>How would you decide that a patient is less than 34 weeks pregnant if the duration of the pregnancy is unknown?
    <ol>
      <li>The estimated fetal weight will be less than 2500 g and the syphysis-fundus measurement will be less than 34 cm.</li>
      <li>The estimated fetal weight will be less than 2000 g and the syphysis-fundus measurement will be less than 33 cm.</li>
      <li>If in doubt the patient should be referred to a level 2 hospital to be evaluated.</li>
      <li>An ultrasound examination needs to be done urgently to establish the correct gestational age.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Salbutamol should not be used in a patient with:
    <ol>
      <li>Asthma.</li>
      <li>Preterm rupture of the membranes.</li>
      <li>Multiple pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Heart valve disease.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What advice should be given to a patient who had a preterm delivery?
    <ol>
      <li>If she only had one previous preterm delivery, there is no need to be concerned about future pregnancies.</li>
      <li>There is a high risk of recurrence, it will be better not to attempt future pregnancies.</li>
      <li>Intervention is only required if a patient had two previous preterm deliveries.</li>
      <li>The patient should be seen at a level 2 hospital before her next pregnancy to be assessed for possible causes. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
