<h2 id="guidelines-for-the-management-of-patients-with-risk-factors-and-medical-problems-during-pregnancy-labour-and-the-puerperium">Guidelines for the management of patients with risk factors and medical problems during pregnancy, labour and the puerperium</h2>

<p>The following tables list most of the risk factors and medical problems which may occur during pregnancy, labour and the puerperium. They also give the possible adverse effects of these conditions, indicate the actions needed, and suggest the level of care required. The tables should be read but need not be learned. These tables provide a very useful reference for both midwives and doctors who are caring for a patients with risk factors.</p>

<p>The following list gives risk factors which may occur during pregnancy together with their possible adverse effects and assorted problems, and actions which can lead to the prevention, early diagnosis and correct management of complications. The level of care required by the patient is noted in the last column. The list also serves as a useful guide to management, and can be referred to when risk factors are present or develop during pregnancy. The management of many of the problems is discussed in more detail elsewhere in the Perinatal Education Programme.</p>

<p>The level of care needed is shown as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 = For low-risk patients</li>
  <li>2 = For intermediate-risk patients</li>
  <li>3 = For high-risk patients</li>
</ul>
