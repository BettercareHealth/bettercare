<h1 id="test-4-antepartum-haemorrhage">Test 4: Antepartum haemorrhage</h1>

<ol>
  <li>What is the definition of an antepartum haemorrhage?
    <ol>
      <li>Any vaginal haemorrhage between conception and delivery.</li>
      <li>Any vaginal haemorrhage during labour.</li>
      <li>Any vaginal haemorrhage between 24 weeks gestation and delivery.</li>
      <li>Any vaginal haemorrhage between 24 weeks and the onset of labour.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Antepartum haemorrhage is an important complication of pregnancy because:
    <ol>
      <li>It is a common cause of iron-deficiency anaemia.</li>
      <li>The fetus may become anaemic.</li>
      <li>It may be due to cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia.</li>
      <li>Both the mother and fetus may die.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following is an important sign of shock due to blood loss?
    <ol>
      <li>A fast pulse rate.</li>
      <li>A low haemoglobin concentration.</li>
      <li>Concentrated urine.</li>
      <li>Pyrexia.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The initial management of a shocked patient with an antepartum haemorrhage is:
    <ol>
      <li>A speculum examination to rule out a local cause for the antepartum haemorrhage.</li>
      <li>An ultrasound examination must be done in order to localise the placenta.</li>
      <li>Assess whether there is engagement of the fetal head as this could rule out a placenta praevia.</li>
      <li>Put up two intravenous infusions to run in quickly.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The amount of bleeding to diagnose an antepartum haemorrhage is:
    <ol>
      <li>A sanitary pad is at least partly soaked with blood.</li>
      <li>A blood-stained vaginal discharge is present.</li>
      <li>A small amount of blood mixed with mucus has been passed.</li>
      <li>Any one of above-mentioned is present.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Why is a speculum examination done on a patient with an antepartum haemorrhage?
    <ol>
      <li>To see how dilated the cervix is.</li>
      <li>To exclude a placenta praevia before a digital examination is done.</li>
      <li>To exclude a local cause of the bleeding from the vagina or cervix.</li>
      <li>To look for a blood clot in the vagina.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If a speculum examination is done on a patient with a history suggestive of a blood-stained discharge, what finding would diagnose an antepartum haemorrhage?
    <ol>
      <li>Bleeding from a closed cervical os.</li>
      <li>A blood-stained discharge seen in the vagina.</li>
      <li>Contact bleeding when the speculum touches the cervix.</li>
      <li>Bulging membranes through a partially dilated cervix.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What is the most likely cause of a massive antepartum haemorrhage that threatens the mother’s life?
    <ol>
      <li>Abruptio placentae.</li>
      <li>Rupture of the uterus.</li>
      <li>Cervical carcinoma.</li>
      <li>Placenta praevia.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following factors will place a patient at the highest risk of abruptio placentae?
    <ol>
      <li>A history of abruptio placentae in a previous pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Any of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Intra-uterine growth restriction.</li>
      <li>Cigarette smoking.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following would suggest an abruptio placentae?
    <ol>
      <li>The uterus is tonically contracted and tender.</li>
      <li>Fetal movements are usually present.</li>
      <li>The haemoglobin concentration is low.</li>
      <li>The uterus is relaxed and the fetal heart rate is normal.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>An antepartum haemorrhage with no fetal heart heard is usually caused by:
    <ol>
      <li>Placenta praevia.</li>
      <li>Abruptio placentae.</li>
      <li>Antepartum haemorrhage of unknown cause.</li>
      <li>Trichomonal vaginitis.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following patients is at an increased risk of placenta praevia?
    <ol>
      <li>A patient with one of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.</li>
      <li>A patient with a multiple pregnancy.</li>
      <li>A patient with intra-uterine growth restriction.</li>
      <li>A patient who smokes.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What symptoms point to the diagnosis of placenta praevia?
    <ol>
      <li>The bleeding is painless.</li>
      <li>The bleeding consists of dark red blood clots.</li>
      <li>The bleeding is associated with severe continuous abdominal pain.</li>
      <li>Fetal movement is absent after the bleed.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Vaginal bleeding due to placenta praevia is usually associated with:
    <ol>
      <li>Fetal parts that are difficult to feel and an absent fetal heart beat.</li>
      <li>Engagement of the fetal head.</li>
      <li>A uterus that is relaxed and not tender on palpation.</li>
      <li>Lower abdominal pain.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>In which of the following patients can placenta praevia be excluded?
    <ol>
      <li>A patient with a slight vaginal bleed.</li>
      <li>When two fifths or less of the fetal head can be palpated above the pelvic brim on abdominal examination.</li>
      <li>A patient with a painless, bright red vaginal bleed.</li>
      <li>A patient with a breech presentation.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What action should you take if a routine ultrasound examination early in pregnancy shows a placenta praevia?
    <ol>
      <li>A repeat ultrasound examination must be arranged at 32 weeks.</li>
      <li>No further investigations are required.</li>
      <li>Book the patient for an elective caesarean section at 38 weeks.</li>
      <li>Refer the patient to hospital where she will be admitted.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

      <li>A vaginal discharge mixed with a small amount of blood.</li>
      <li>Bleeding after intercourse.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following is typical of a ‘show’?
    <ol>
      <li>A heavy vaginal bleed.</li>
      <li>A slight bleed consisting of blood mixed with mucus.</li>
      <li>A mucoid vaginal discharge.</li>
      <li>Blood in the urine.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What would you find on speculum examination with a history of a ‘show’?
    <ol>
      <li>The cervix is a few centimetres dilated and the membranes are bulging.</li>
      <li>The bleeding will come through a closed cervical os.</li>
      <li>An offensive vaginal discharge.</li>
      <li>Contact bleeding will occur if the cervix is touched.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>How should you manage a patient who presents at 30 weeks of gestation with a blood-stained vaginal discharge which is caused by vaginitis?
    <ol>
      <li>The urine should be tested with a reagent strip for protein, nitrites and leucocytes.</li>
      <li>A cytology smear must be taken from the cervix to identify the organism causing the vaginitis.</li>
      <li>A vaginal examination should be done in theatre as with any other patient who presents with an antepartum haemorrhage.</li>
      <li>The patient and her partner must be treated with metronidazole (Flagyl).</li>
