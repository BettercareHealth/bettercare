<h1 id="test-1-antenatal-care">Test 1: Antenatal care</h1>

<ol>
  <li>An extra-uterine pregnancy is suggested by:
    <ol>
      <li>A uterus that is larger than expected for the duration of pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Morning sickness and breast tenderness.</li>
      <li>Lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding.</li>
      <li>The absence of fetal movements.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>A woman should book for antenatal care:
    <ol>
      <li>Before she falls pregnant.</li>
      <li>When she has missed her second menstrual period.</li>
      <li>When she first feels fetal movements.</li>
      <li>When she is 28 weeks pregnant.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>When a patient has had a ceasarean section:
    <ol>
      <li>The type of uterine incision is of no importance.</li>
      <li>Only those patients who had a vertical lower segment incision may be allowed to labour normally.</li>
      <li>Only those patients who had a transverse lower segment incision may be allowed to labour normally.</li>
      <li>Only those patients who had a transverse lower segment incision for a non-recurring indication may be allowed to labour normally.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following risk factors from a patient’s past obstetric history carries the highest risk in a subsequent pregnancy?
    <ol>
      <li>A previous caesarean section.</li>
      <li>An infant weighing more than 4000 g at birth.</li>
      <li>A previous perinatal death.</li>
      <li>A previous ectopic pregnancy.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>A woman books for antenatal care at 12 weeks gestation. Which of the following in her present obstetric history would worry you most?
    <ol>
      <li>Flu-like symptoms associated with a rash.</li>
      <li>Nausea and vomiting in the mornings.</li>
      <li>Heartburn and constipation.</li>
      <li>Slight ankle oedema.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The last normal menstrual period may be used to calculate the duration of pregnancy:
    <ol>
      <li>If that was the last menstrual period while the patient was on her last packet of oral contraceptive pills.</li>
      <li>If the patient has a regular cycle and she was not on contraceptives.</li>
      <li>If the last menstrual period had started earlier and had been shorter than the patient would have expected.</li>
      <li>Patient information about their last menstrual period is always wrong.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>A cervical smear for cytology must be done during the first antenatal visit as part of the gynaecological examination:
    <ol>
      <li>In all women.</li>
      <li>Only if the cervix appears abnormal.</li>
      <li>In all women 30 years or more who have not had a previous smear which was reported as normal.</li>
      <li>Only if there is a symptomatic vaginal discharge (e.g. itchy or burning).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The abdominal examination is a useful assessment of the duration of pregnancy:
    <ol>
      <li>From 8–12 weeks.</li>
      <li>From 10–16 weeks.</li>
      <li>From 13–17 weeks.</li>
      <li>From 18–24 weeks.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If a patient is 10 weeks pregnant:
    <ol>
      <li>The fundus will be palpable 2 cm above the pelvic symphysis.</li>
      <li>The fundus is not palpable abdominally and it is, therefore, not possible to determine whether the dates correlate with the size of the uterus.</li>
      <li>It would be better to ask her to return in 6 weeks time for booking.</li>
      <li>The uterine size may be determined by doing a bimanual vaginal examination with fair accuracy.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The best method of assessing the duration of pregnancy by physical examination at 18 or more weeks is:
    <ol>
      <li>The symphysis-fundus measurement.</li>
      <li>Bimanual palpation of the uterus on vaginal examination.</li>
      <li>Palpation of the abdomen.</li>
      <li>To establish the lie of the fetus and assess the size of the fetal head.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If the uterine fundus is just below the umbilicus (20 weeks) and the patient is 18 weeks pregnant by dates:
    <ol>
      <li>The dates must be considered correct and used to determine the duration of pregnancy.</li>
      <li>The fundal height must be considered correct and used to determine the duration of pregnancy.</li>
      <li>An ultrasound examination must be requested and the result used to determine the duration of pregnancy.</li>
      <li>The average duration of 19 weeks must be accepted as the correct duration of pregnancy.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>A uterus that is smaller than expected may be due to:
    <ol>
      <li>A breech presentation.</li>
      <li>An intra-uterine death.</li>
      <li>Polyhydramnios.</li>
      <li>None of the above.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Antenatal ultrasound examination is an accurate method of determining the duration of pregnancy up to:
    <ol>
      <li>28 weeks.</li>
      <li>24 weeks.</li>
      <li>20 weeks.</li>
      <li>16 weeks.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>During the antenatal period ultrasonography must be done between 18 and 22 weeks:
    <ol>
      <li>On very obese patients where determination of the duration of pregnancy is difficult.</li>
      <li>On patients needing elective delivery, e.g. those with 2 previous caesarean sections.</li>
      <li>On patients with a history of severe pre-eclampsia before 34 weeks gestation.</li>
      <li>In all of the above patients.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Which of the following results indicate active syphilis?
    <ol>
      <li>A negative RPR.</li>
      <li>A positive RPR plus a negative TPHA.</li>
      <li>A positive RPR plus a positive TPHA.</li>
      <li>A CIN III lesion on cervical cytology smear.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>A positive VDRL indicates the presence of syphilis if:
    <ol>
      <li>The titre is 1:4 or more.</li>
      <li>The titre is 1:8 or more.</li>
      <li>The titre is 1:16 or more.</li>
      <li>Any titre is present.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Syphilis in pregnancy should be treated with:
    <ol>
      <li>Nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin).</li>
      <li>Benzathene penicillin (Bicillin LA or Penilente LA).</li>
      <li>Tetracycline.</li>
      <li>Ampicillin.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Blood should be taken to determine the presence of anti-D antibodies at 26, 32 and 38 weeks in:
    <ol>
      <li>All Rh-negative patients with an anti-D titre of 1:8 or more.</li>
      <li>All Rh-negative patients.</li>
      <li>All Rh-positive patients.</li>
      <li>All pregnant patients.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>How often should a woman at low risk, who lives near a clinic, visit the antenatal clinic between 28 and 34 weeks?
    <ol>
      <li>Weekly.</li>
      <li>Every 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Once a month.</li>
      <li>No visit is required between these dates.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The visit at 34 weeks is important because:
    <ol>
      <li>The fetus now becomes viable and the patient must monitor the fetal movements.</li>
      <li>A vaginal examination must be done on patients who are at risk of preterm labour to determine whether there are cervical changes.</li>
      <li>The lie and presentation of the fetus are now important and have to be carefully determined.</li>
      <li>A repeat ultrasound examination must now be done on patients who had ultrasonography at 18 and 22 weeks.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
