<h1 id="test-3-protection-of-healthcare-workers">Test 3: Protection of Healthcare Workers</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Can healthcare workers in an Ebola Treatment Unit become infected by indirect contact with contaminated equipment or surfaces?
    <ol>
      <li>Not with Ebola</li>
      <li>Only if the contaminated object touches the healthcare worker’s mouth</li>
      <li>Only if the equipment or surface is wet</li>
      <li>Yes as indirect contact is a method of spreading Ebola</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What are standard precautions?
    <ol>
      <li>Actions which should be applied to all patients whether they are thought to be infectious or not</li>
      <li>Precautions taken only if a patient is thought to have an infectious disease</li>
      <li>Special precautions taken when caring for Ebola patients</li>
      <li>Special precautions taken when burying someone who has died of Ebola</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Transmission-based precautions in an Ebola outbreak:
    <ol>
      <li>Are not needed if standard precautions are applied</li>
      <li>Are needed in addition to standard precautions</li>
      <li>Are only needed when patients are transported</li>
      <li>Are only needed when moving corpses</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>When caring for an Ebola patient:
    <ol>
      <li>Airborne precautions are needed</li>
      <li>Droplet precautions are needed</li>
      <li>Both droplet and airborne precautions are needed</li>
      <li>Only direct contact precautions are needed</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Hand hygiene includes:
    <ol>
      <li>Any activity that reduces the number of micro-organisms on the hands</li>
      <li>Handwashing only</li>
      <li>Alcohol handrub only</li>
      <li>Surgical scrub only</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>When using an alcohol handrub for hand hygiene:
    <ol>
      <li>It should contain 20 to 30% alcohol</li>
      <li>Dry the hands with a paper towel immediately afterwards</li>
      <li>Allow the hands to remain wet for at least 15 seconds</li>
      <li>There is no need for added moisturising agents to protect the skin</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Alcohol-based handrub is a very effective method of hand hygiene if:
    <ol>
      <li>The hands are visibly soiled (dirt, blood or body fluids)</li>
      <li>The hands are not visibly soiled</li>
      <li>The hands are well washed with soap and water afterwards</li>
      <li>The hands are well washed with a detergent after the handrub</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What are the “WHO Five moments for Hand Hygiene”?
    <ol>
      <li>The 5 organisations which promote good hand hygiene</li>
      <li>The 5 times when hand hygiene is important</li>
      <li>The 5 methods that can be used to provide hand hygiene</li>
      <li>The 5 steps that should be followed when hands are washed correctly</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Is a solution of 0.05% chlorine suitable for routine hand hygiene?
    <ol>
      <li>Yes as it is more effective than hand washing</li>
      <li>Yes as it needs a short contact time with the skin</li>
      <li>No as it is very expensive</li>
      <li>No as it can irritate and damage the skin</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What personal protective equipment is needed when taking a blood sample from an Ebola patient?
    <ol>
      <li>The protective equipment must ensure that no skin is left uncovered</li>
      <li>A mask and gloves are adequate</li>
      <li>A mask and double gloves are adequate</li>
      <li>A mask, goggles and double gloves are adequate</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What types of eye protection are recommended when caring for Ebola patients?
    <ol>

      <li>Goggles or faceshields can be used</li>
      <li>Only a face-shield is suitable</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

    <ol>
      <li>It reduces the risk of splashes or droplets reaching the mouth and nose</li>
      <li>It prevents airborne spread of Ebola virus</li>
      <li>It prevents the healthcare worker breathing on the patient and possibly spreading influenza virus</li>
      <li>It prevents the patient identifying the healthcare worker</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What type of head cover is recommended when managing Ebola patients?
    <ol>
      <li>A cotton surgical cap</li>
      <li>A surgical cap, goggles and face mask</li>
      <li>A balaclava or head cover that covers most of the head and neck</li>
      <li>Head cover is not needed if goggles and a face mask are worn</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>When wearing personal protective equipment:
    <ol>
      <li>Both a gown and apron are needed</li>
      <li>A gown alone is adequate</li>
      <li>An apron over working clothes is adequate</li>
      <li>Neither a gown nor apron are needed if the working clothes are well washed after going off duty</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What benefits are there from wearing gloves when touching an Ebola patient?
    <ol>
      <li>Gloves can be used instead of having to wash hands</li>
      <li>Gloves help protect during both direct and indirect contact</li>
      <li>Gloves help protect the hands from disinfectants</li>

      <li>Cleaning the protective equipment after use</li>
      <li>Putting the protective equipment on</li>
      <li>Taking the protective equipment off</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The main role of a “PPE buddy” is to:
    <ol>
      <li>Collect the used personal protective clothing and safely dispose of it </li>
      <li>Provide emotional support when caring for Ebola patients</li>
      <li>Helping with putting on and taking off personal protective clothing</li>
      <li>Notifying your family if you become infected with Ebola</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>In which order (sequence) should protective clothing be taken off?
    <ol>
      <li>Usually the boots are removed first</li>
      <li>The outer gloves can be taken off first</li>
      <li>The head cover and eye protection should be taken off last</li>
      <li>The second pair of gloves should be removed last</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If personal protective equipment is not available:
    <ol>
      <li>Ordinary clothing is adequate if the person is careful to avoid splashes of body fluid</li>
      <li>Handwashing alone will prevent most infections</li>
      <li>Every available precaution should still be used such as plastic bags in place of gloves</li>
      <li>Under no circumstance should they provide care for an Ebola patient</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Healthcare workers who have been caring for Ebola patients can safely use public transport, attend mass gatherings and return to routine work after:
    <ol>
      <li>A 21 day post exposure period</li>
      <li>A 15 day post exposure period</li>
      <li>A 7 day post exposure period</li>
      <li>A 48 hour post exposure period</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
