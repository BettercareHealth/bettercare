<h2 id="about-the-bettercare-series">About the Bettercare series</h2>

<p>Bettercare publishes an innovative series of distance-learning books for healthcare professionals, developed by the Perinatal Education Trust, Eduhealthcare, the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation and the Desmond Tutu TB Centre, with contributions from numerous experts.</p>

<p>Our aim is to provide appropriate, affordable and up-to-date learning material for healthcare workers in under-resourced areas, so that they can learn, practise and deliver excellent patient care.</p>

<p>The Bettercare series is built on the experience of the Perinatal Education Programme (PEP), which has provided learning opportunities to over 60 000 nurses and doctors in South Africa since 1992. Many of the educational methods developed by PEP are now being adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p>

<h2 id="why-decentralised-learning">Why decentralised learning?</h2>

<p>Continuing education for health workers traditionally consists of courses and workshops run by formal trainers at large central hospitals. These courses are expensive to attend, often far away from the health workers’ families and places of work, and the content frequently fails to address the biggest healthcare challenges of poor, rural communities.</p>

<p>To help solve these many problems, a self-help decentralised learning method has been developed which addresses the needs of professional healthcare workers, especially those in poor, rural communities.</p>

<h2 id="books-in-the-bettercare-series">Books in the Bettercare series</h2>

<h3 id="maternal-care">Maternal Care</h3>

<p><em>Maternal Care</em> addresses all the common and important problems that occur during pregnancy, labour, delivery and the puerperium. It covers the antenatal and postnatal care of healthy women with normal pregnancies, monitoring and managing the progress of labour, specific medical problems during pregnancy, labour and the puerperium, family planning and regionalised perinatal care. Skills workshops teach clinical examination in pregnancy and labour, routine screening tests, the use of an antenatal card and partogram, measuring blood pressure, detecting proteinuria and performing and repairing an episiotomy. <em>Maternal Care</em> is aimed at health workers in level 1 hospitals or clinics.</p>

<h3 id="primary-maternal-care">Primary Maternal Care</h3>

<p><em>Primary Maternal Care</em> addresses the needs of health workers who provide antenatal and postnatal care, but do not conduct deliveries. It is adapted from theory chapters and skills workshops from <em>Maternal Care</em>. This book is ideal for midwives and doctors providing primary maternal care in level 1 district hospitals and clinics, and complements the national protocol of antenatal care in South Africa.</p>

<h3 id="intrapartum-care">Intrapartum Care</h3>

<h3 id="saving-mothers-and-babies">Saving Mothers and Babies</h3>

<p><em>Saving Mothers and Babies</em> was developed in response to the high maternal and perinatal mortality rates found in most developing countries. Learning material used in this book is based on the results of the annual confidential enquiries into maternal deaths and the Saving Mothers and Saving Babies reports published in South Africa. It addresses the basic principles of mortality audit, maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, managing mortality meetings and ways of reducing maternal and perinatal mortality rates. This book should be used together with the Perinatal Problem Identification Programme (PPIP).</p>

<h3 id="birth-defects">Birth Defects</h3>

<p><em>Birth Defects</em> was written for healthcare workers who look after individuals with birth defects, their families, and women who are at increased risk of giving birth to an infant with a birth defect. Special attention is given to modes of inheritance, medical genetic counselling, and birth defects due to chromosomal abnormalities, single gene defects, teratogens and multifactorial inheritance. This book is being used in the Genetics Education Programme which trains healthcare workers in genetic counselling in South Africa.</p>

<h3 id="perinatal-hiv">Perinatal HIV</h3>

It includes chapters on IPC programmes, risk management, health facility design, outbreak surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship.</p>

<h2 id="format-of-the-courses">Format of the courses</h2>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>

<p>The learning objectives are clearly stated at the start of each chapter. They help the participant to identify and understand the important lessons to be learned.</p>

<h3 id="pre--and-post-tests">Pre- and post-tests</h3>

<p>There is a multiple-choice test of 20 questions for each chapter at the end of the book. Participants are encouraged to take a pre-test before starting each chapter, to benchmark their current knowledge, and a post-test after each chapter, to assess what they have learned. Self-assessment allows participants to monitor their own progress through the course.</p>

<h3 id="question-and-answer-format">Question-and-answer format</h3>

<p>Theoretical knowledge is presented in a question-and-answer format, which encourages the learner to actively participate in the learning process. In this way, the participant is led step by step through the definitions, causes, diagnosis, prevention, dangers and management of a particular problem.</p>

<p>Participants should cover the answer for a few minutes with a piece of paper while thinking about the correct reply to each question. This method helps learning. </p>

<p>Simplified flow diagrams are also used, where necessary, to indicate the correct approach to diagnosing or managing a particular problem. </p>

<p>Each question is identified with the number of the chapter, followed by the number of the question, e.g. 5-23.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Important practical lessons are emphasised like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<dl>
  <dt>Note</dt>
  <dd>Additional, non-essential information is provided for interest and given in notes like this. These facts are not used in the case studies or included in the multiple-choice questions.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="case-studies">Case studies</h3>

<p>Each chapter closes with a few case studies which encourage the participant to consolidate and apply what was learned earlier in the chapter. These studies give the participant an opportunity to see the problem as it usually presents itself in the clinic or hospital. The participant should attempt to answer each question in the case study before reading the correct answer. </p>

<h3 id="practical-training">Practical training</h3>

<p>Certain chapters contain skills workshops, which need to be practised by the participants (preferably in groups). The skills workshops, which are often illustrated with line drawings, list essential equipment and present step-by-step instructions on how to perform each task. If participants aren’t familiar with a practical skill, they are encouraged to ask an appropriate medical or nursing colleague to demonstrate the clinical skill to them. In this way, senior personnel are encouraged to share their skills with their colleagues.</p>

<h3 id="final-examination">Final examination</h3>

<p>On completion of each course, participants can take a 75-question, self-managed multiple-choice examination.</p>

<p>All the exam questions will be taken from the multiple-choice tests from the book. The content of the skills workshops will not be included in the examination.</p>

<p>Participants need to achieve at least 80% in the examination in order to successfully complete the course. Successful candidates will be sent a certificate which states that they have successfully completed that course. South African doctors can earn CPD points on the successful completion of an examination.</p>

<h2 id="contributors">Contributors</h2>

<p>The developers of our learning materials are a multi-disciplinary team of nurses, midwives, obstetricians, neonatologists, and general paediatricians. The development and review of all course material is overseen by the Editor-in-Chief, emeritus Professor Dave Woods, a previous head of neonatal medicine at the University of Cape Town who now consults to UNICEF and the WHO.</p>

<h3 id="perinatal-education-trust">Perinatal Education Trust</h3>

<p>Books developed by the Perinatal Education Programme are provided as cheaply as possible. Writing and updating the programme is both funded and managed on a non-profit basis by the Perinatal Education Trust.</p>

<h3 id="eduhealthcare">Eduhealthcare</h3>

<p>Eduhealthcare is a non-profit organisation based in South Africa. It aims to improve health and wellbeing, especially in poor communities, through affordable education for healthcare workers. To this end it provides financial support for the development and publishing of the Bettercare series.</p>

<h3 id="the-desmond-tutu-hiv-foundation">The Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation</h3>

<p>The Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, is a centre of excellence in HIV medicine, building capacity through training and enhancing knowledge through research.</p>

<h3 id="the-desmond-tutu-tuberculosis-centre">The Desmond Tutu Tuberculosis Centre</h3>

<p>The Desmond Tutu Tuberculosis Centre at Stellenbosch University, South Africa, strives to improve the health of vulnerable groups through the education of healthcare workers and community members, and by influencing policy based on research into the epidemiology of childhood tuberculosis, multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, HIV/TB co-infection and preventing the spread of TB and HIV in southern Africa.</p>

<h3 id="updating-the-course-material">Updating the course material</h3>

<p>Bettercare learning materials are regularly updated to keep up with developments and changes in healthcare protocols. Course participants can make important contributions to the continual improvement of Bettercare books by reporting factual or language errors, by identifying sections that are difficult to understand, and by suggesting additions or improvements to the contents. Details of alternative or better forms of management would be particularly appreciated. Please send any comments or suggestions to the Editor-in-Chief, Professor Dave Woods.</p>
