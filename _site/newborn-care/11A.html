<h2 id="using-a-flow-meter-with-humidifier">Using a flow meter with humidifier</h2>

<h3 id="a-the-flow-meter">11-a The flow meter</h3>

<p>It is important to measure the flow rate of gas given to an infant with a flow meter. The flow meter is usually plugged into an oxygen/air blender. However, the flow meter can also be plugged directly into an oxygen wall plug or the reducing value of an oxygen cylinder.</p>

<p>The flow of gas is measured in litres per minute and can be adjusted by turning an adjusting wheel. A flow rate of 5 litres per minute is usually used into a head box. A high flow rate wastes gas and cools the infant while a low flow rate may allow carbon dioxide to accumulate in the head box.</p>

<h3 id="b-the-humidifier">11-b The humidifier</h3>

<p>It is also important to use a humidifier together with the flow meter so that water vapour can be added to the dry gas (oxygen, medical air or a mixture). If a humidifier is not used the infant will breathe very dry gas which may damage the airways.</p>

<p>A simple humidifier (‘water bubbler’ at room temperature) is usually used to add water vapour to the dry gas if a head box or nasal cannulas are used. Sterile or boiled water (which has been allowed to cool) is added to the humidifier bottle until the water level reaches the full mark. When the water level approaches the empty mark more water must be added. The water must be changed and the humidifier must be cleaned every day or when the humidifier is to be used for another infant. Dangerous bacteria such as Pseudomonas can grow well in water and, therefore, the humidifier should only be filled with water when it is being used. The humidifier should be cleaned with detergent or soap and water, and be allowed to drip dry. The switch on the humidifier must be kept on ‘bubbles’ and not ‘jet’. The humidifier must be dry during storage.</p>

<p>Some humidifiers both warm and humidify the gas. These are expensive and are usually used with a blender. When infants are given nasal prong CPAP or are ventilated via an endotracheal tube (except during resuscitation), warmed, humidified gas must be used as the high flow rates can cool and dry out the mucosa.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-blender-or-venturi">Using a blender or venturi</h2>

<p>Except during an emergency resuscitation, 100% oxygen from a cylinder or piped source should not be used as pure oxygen is toxic to many tissues, especially the retina of the eye. Whenever possible oxygen should be mixed (blended) with medical air using a blender or with room air using a venturi.</p>

<h3 id="c-the-components-of-an-oxygenair-blender">11-c The components of an oxygen/air blender</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The plastic gas pipes: The pipe for oxygen is usually white while the pipe for medical air is usually black. Each pipe ends in a steel connector that must be plugged into a wall gas fitting or a reduction valve on a gas cylinder. The shape of the 2 connectors differs to prevent the pipe being connected to the incorrect source. The oxygen connector is 6 sided while the medical air connector has 2 flat sides and 2 curved sides. The wall fitting for oxygen is white and the wall fitting for medical air is grey.</li>
  <li>The blender unit: This, with the gas pipes, is usually attached to a supporting rail on the wall. The blender also has emergency escape valves which operate if the gas pressure gets too high. An alarm will sound if one of the pipes is not plugged in properly, or the pressure of oxygen or air is too low. The dial which controls the mixture of oxygen and air can be set at any combination from 21% oxygen (i.e. pure medical air) to 100% oxygen (pure oxygen).</li>
  <li>The flow meter with humidifier (either room temperature or warmed).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="d-using-a-venturi">11-d Using a venturi</h3>

<p>If a blender is not available, a venturi can be used with a head box. A venturi is cheaper than a blender but not as accurate. The venturi is a short plastic tube to which a pipe supplying oxygen is attached. The oxygen passing through the venturi sucks in room air and, thereby, mixes the 2 gases. The venturi is usually attached to a head box (oxygen hood). Some venturis provide a fixed concentration of oxygen while others can be used to give the concentration required. The latter are preferred. When using a venturi attached to a head box, an oxygen flow rate of 5 litres must be used. If possible the percentage of oxygen in the head box should still be accurately measured with an oxygen monitor.</p>

<h2 id="using-an-oxygen-monitor">Using an oxygen monitor</h2>

<p>Whenever an infant is given oxygen into a head box the FiO₂ (fraction of inspired oxygen) must be measured with an oxygen monitor as too high or too low a concentration of oxygen may be dangerous for that infant if it results in too much or too little oxygen in the blood. The FiO₂ cannot be controlled accurately with a flow meter alone. If an oxygen monitor is not available then a blender or venturi should be used to determine the approximate FiO₂, provided a flow of 5 litres or more is used.</p>

<h3 id="e-the-components-of-an-oxygen-monitor">11-e The components of an oxygen monitor</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The monitoring unit</strong>: This is usually attached to a rail or stands on a shelf. On the front of the unit is an on/off switch, a display of the FiO₂, high and low settings, a calibration knob and an alarm light. The monitor is powered by batteries that have to be replaced at intervals. Most models have a ‘low battery’ display to warn that the battery is getting flat.</li>
  <li><strong>The oxygen sensor</strong>: This is attached to the monitoring unit by a thin cable. The sensor is placed in the head box next to the infant’s head.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="f-calibrating-the-oxygen-monitor">11-f Calibrating the oxygen monitor</h3>

<p>Place the sensor in room air and switch on the monitor. The display should read 21%. If not, adjust the calibration knob until the display reads 21%. The monitor should always be calibrated before it is used. It should also be calibrated at least daily while in use.</p>

<h3 id="g-using-the-oxygen-monitor">11-g Using the oxygen monitor</h3>

<p>First calibrate the monitor with room air. Then place the sensor into the head box. The display should now give the FiO₂ in the head box. Set the high and the low alarm limits to 5% above and 5% below the required FiO₂. If the display falls outside these limits, the red alarm light will come on and the alarm buzzer will sound. Silence the alarm by correcting the air/oxygen mixture to the required FiO₂. The display should be read and recorded on the observation chart at regular intervals while the infant is receiving extra oxygen. Remember that the monitor measures the FiO₂ but does not control the FiO₂. The FiO₂ cannot be changed by simply adjusting the oxygen monitor!</p>

<h2 id="using-a-pulse-oximeter-oxygen-saturation-monitor">Using a pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation monitor)</h2>

<p>A pulse oximeter (also called an oxygen saturation monitor) measures the saturation (amount) of oxygen in the red cells of small arteries under the skin. The result is expressed as a percentage and the normal saturation of oxygen (SaO₂) in a newborn infant is 86–92%.</p>

<p>A SaO₂ above 92% is safe only if the infant is breathing room air.</p>

<p>A saturation below this range may be dangerous to the infant. The measurement is made by shining a bright light through the skin and then determining the colour of the transmitted light on the other side with a sensor. If the blood is red (well saturated) the SaO₂ reading will be normal or high. A low reading will be obtained if the blood is cyanosed. The monitor also measures the pulse rate by detecting the arterial pulsations in the small vessels in the skin.</p>

<h3 id="h-components-of-a-pulse-oximeter">11-h Components of a pulse oximeter</h3>

<p>The monitor is attached to a skin sensor by a thin cable. The monitor is powered by electricity (via a power cable which plugs into a wall fitting) or battery and displays a pattern of the pulse wave together with the percentage saturation and pulse rate. A number of different designs of sensor are available. One type looks like a clothes peg and can be clipped onto the infant’s hand, foot or ear lobe. Another type can be strapped onto a hand or foot with tape, while an adult finger sensor can, with difficulty, be slipped over the infant’s foot. A regular pulse wave indicates that the skin sensor is correctly positioned. The pulse wave may be displayed as a moving line on a screen or a digital display of vertically arranged lights.</p>

<h3 id="i-using-a-pulse-oximeter">11-i Using a pulse oximeter</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Attach the sensor to the infant’s hand, foot or ear and then switch on the monitor. It may take a short while before it displays the pulse wave on the screen.</li>
  <li>A good, regular pulse wave should be displayed. If not, adjust the position of the sensor slightly or move the sensor to another part of the body.</li>
  <li>Set the upper and lower limits for the SaO₂ and pulse rate. This is usually done by simply pressing the limit buttons. The SaO₂ limits are usually set at 86% and 92% while the pulse rate limits are usually set to 120–160 beats per minute.</li>
  <li>You should now be able to read both the SaO₂ and the pulse rate on the display panel. If the pulse wave is poor or the SaO₂ or pulse rate is abnormal the alarm will sound. Press the alarm button to switch off the alarm and take the necessary action.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="j-problems-with-a-pulse-oximeter">11-j Problems with a pulse oximeter</h3>

<ol>
  <li>If the infant moves a lot it may not be poss­ible to obtain a good pulse wave reading and the monitor will alarm repeatedly.</li>
  <li>If the infant’s perfusion is poor it is best to attach the sensor to the hand or ear rather than the foot.</li>
  <li>If the infant is receiving phototherapy or is under a bright light, it is preferable to cover the sensor with a nappy or piece of cloth as the light may interfere with the function of the sensor.</li>
</ol>

<p>The pulse oximeter should be used when the measurement of SaO₂ is needed on a sick infant. The sensor can be left attached for continuous monitoring or the sensor can be attached at regular intervals for a single reading. The monitor should not be used simply to obtain the pulse rate. If the pulse rate recorded by the monitor differs from the correct heart rate, then the monitor is not functioning properly and, as a result, the SaO₂ displayed may be incorrect. When moving the sensor from one infant to another, the sensor should first be wiped with an alcohol swab to prevent the spread of infection.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Note</dt>
  <dd>A red and infrared light is used in a pulse oximeter to measure the colour of red cells. Well-oxygenated haemoglobin absorbs more infrared light while poorly oxygenated haemoglobin absorbs more red light. The barr graph indicates when the pulse of arterial blood enters the capillaries. The oximeter reading is taken at the height of the pulse and, therefore, reflects the oxygen saturation of arterial blood. A good pulse is needed to get an accurate reading.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="providing-nasal-cannula-oxygen">Providing nasal cannula oxygen</h2>

<p>This is the best way of providing an infant with extra oxygen if CPAP or ventilation is not required.</p>

<h3 id="k-setting-up-the-equipment-needed">11-k Setting up the equipment needed</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Source of oxygen and medical air which is mixed in a blender. If a blender is not available, 100% oxygen can be used.</li>
  <li>A flow meter. The flow rate is set between 0.5 and 1 litre per minute. Do not use high flow rates.</li>
  <li>A humidifier (bubbler) at room temperature</li>
  <li>Connecting tubing</li>
  <li>A nasal cannula set. This consists of a loop of tubing with two short nasal cannulas at the centre of the loop. The nasal cannula set is plugged into the connecting tubing from the blender or oxygen source.</li>
  <li>It is very useful to have a pulse oximeter to make sure that the correct percentage oxygen is being given.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="l-attaching-nasal-cannulas">11-l Attaching nasal cannulas</h3>

<p>The nasal cannula set is slipped over the infant’s head so that both short cannulas sit comfortably in the nostrils. The two tubes are then gently pulled together at the back of the head. Usually the tubing is taped to the infant’s face on either side of the nose. This will keep the nasal cannulas in place and prevent them pulling out.</p>

<h2 id="providing-nasal-cpap">Providing nasal CPAP</h2>

<p>It is important not to attempt to provide nasal CPAP unless the medical and nursing staff have been trained in the correct method to apply this management.</p>

<h3 id="m-cpap-apparatus">11-m CPAP apparatus</h3>

<p>CPAP is given to the infant with a CPAP apparatus. This may be made up of individual parts or bought as a Flow Driver, which is a commercial device designed specially for providing CPAP.</p>

<p>The components of a CPAP apparatus are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A blender with air and oxygen pipes to connect to the gas source (wall plugs or cylinders). This will allow a choice of FiO₂ between 0.21 and 1.0. An oximeter is very useful as it accurately measures the FiO₂ being provided.</li>
  <li>A flow meter to control the flow of mixed air and oxygen in litres per minute. Setting the flow rate controls the amount of CPAP provided.</li>
  <li>A warmed humidifier</li>
  <li>A pressure gauge. This allows the pressure (CPAP) to be measured.</li>
  <li>Tubing (pipes for the circuit) to connect the humidifier to the nose piece. The single tube from the humidifier divides into 2 smaller tubes, one going to each nasal prong.</li>
  <li>A special nose piece with interchangeable nasal prongs. Three sizes of prongs are needed. Two small tubes carry the blended and humidified air and oxygen mixture to the nose piece while a single larger tube allows the infant to exhale through the nose piece. The temperature probe from the humidifier plugs into the tubing at the point where the single tube divides into 2 tubes.</li>
  <li>A cotton or woollen cap with tapes to hold the nose piece in position, as well as strapping to attach the tubing, is needed.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="n-setting-up-the-cpap-apparatus">11-n Setting up the CPAP apparatus</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Place the infant supine (back lying on the bed) under an overhead radiant heater or in a close incubator.</li>
  <li>It is useful to place a small rolled-up nappy under the infant’s shoulders to get the head and neck in the correct position.</li>
  <li>The infant should not be fed and an orogastric tube should be passed and kept on open drainage to prevent abdominal distension. An intravenous infusion is needed.</li>
  <li>A well-fitting cotton or woollen cap should be put in place so that it fits snugly over the back of the infant’s head.</li>
  <li>Choose the correct size nasal prongs which fit comfortably into the infant’s nostrils. It is very important to choose the correct size of nasal prongs which are not too tight as this can cause damage to the infant’s nose.</li>
  <li>Connect the nasal prongs to the nosepiece.</li>
  <li>The CPAP nose piece is put into position and firmly attached.</li>
  <li>The temperature of the humidifier must be set at 37 °C.</li>
  <li>The required FiO₂ is set and the flow adjusted to provide CPAP of 5 cm water.</li>
  <li>Monitor the infant carefully with regular observation. This is very important as the nasal prongs can easily be dislodged. Routine suctioning is not needed. If possible the infant should be monitored with a pulse oximeter.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="o-attaching-the-nose-piece">11-o Attaching the nose piece</h3>

<p>A cotton or woollen cap is placed on the infant’s head. Tapes attached to the cap are then tied to the nose piece so that the nose piece is held in place. Tape the ties between the cap and nose piece to the sides of the infant’s face. It helps if a piece of Stomadhesive, about 1 by 2 cm, is cut and stuck over the infants cheekbones in front of the ears on both sides of the face. The tubing can now be taped to the Stomadhesive pieces. This protects the infant’s skin.</p>

<p>The 2 inflow tubes should rest on a roll of cotton stocking placed on top of the infant’s head. The cotton roll is taped to the top of the cotton cap. The small tubes can now be strapped to the cap to help keep the nose piece in place if the infant moves her head.</p>

<h3 id="p-managing-an-infant-on-nasal-cpap">11-p Managing an infant on nasal CPAP</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Record the infant’s respiratory rate, heart rate, colour, presence or absence of recession or apnoea. Record the pulse oximeter reading if available.</li>
  <li>Check that the nasal prongs are in position and make sure the nasal prongs are not too tight.</li>
  <li>Check the temperature and water level of the humidifier and remove any excess water from the tubing.</li>
  <li>Adjust the FiO₂ if needed.</li>
  <li>Only suction if needed.</li>
  <li>If necessary the CPAP pressure can be increased to 8 cm water.</li>
  <li>Wean both the CPAP pressure and FiO₂ as the infant improves clinically.</li>
</ol>

<p>Do not provide nasal CPAP unless the staff have received appropriate training.</p>
