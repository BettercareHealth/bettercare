	-	Relieving anxiety
	-	Putting the patient to sleep
	-	All of the above
2.	Anaesthesia means:
	-	The relief of pain
	-	Relieving anxiety
	+	Loss of all sensation
	-	Putting the patient to sleep
3.	Which of the following statements is correct?
	-	All patients experience severe pain during labour.
	+	The severity of pain experienced during labour varies widely between different patients.
	-	Pain is only experienced during labour when the cervix is almost fully dilated.
	-	Pain is only experienced when the patient is in the second stage of labour.
4.	Why do anxiety and fear make the pain of labour worse?
	-	Anxiety increases the strength of uterine contractions.
	-	Anxiety increases the duration of uterine contractions.
	-	Anxiety increases the frequency of uterine contractions.
	+	Anxiety lowers a patient’s pain threshold.
5.	Pain relief during labour:
	-	Should only be provided by powerful analgesics which are known to be effective
	+	Starts with the preparation for labour during the antenatal period
	-	Is only needed if the patient receives an oxytocin infusion
	-	Is only needed if the patient does not have her partner or another family member with her
6.	Which of the following statements about rubbing a patient’s back during labour is correct?
	-	Rubbing a patient’s back is an ‘old wives’ tale’ and is of no value.
	-	It should not be done as physical contact with the patient should be avoided.
	+	The pain impulses from the uterus and cervix are experienced as less painful if the patient’s lower back is rubbed.
	-	There is no physiological reason why rubbing the patient’s back should relieve labour pains.
7.	Which of the following statements about pain relief in labour is correct?
	+	The relief of pain often speeds up the progress of labour.
	-	The relief of pain often slows the progress of labour.
	-	Patients must accept pain as part of normal labour.
	-	Pain relief in labour should only be given to patients who obviously are suffering severe pain.
8.	When should a patient be given pain relief in labour?
	-	When a patient’s cervix is 4 to 6 cm dilated
	-	When a patient is having 3 strong contractions in 10 minutes
	-	When a patient reaches the active phase of the first stage of labour
	+	When a patient asks for pain relief
9.	Promethazine (Phenergan) or hydroxyzine (Aterax) should always be given together with pethidine for the relief of pain during labour because:
	-	They have a sedative effect
	-	They decrease nausea and vomiting which are common side effects of pethidine
	-	They increase the analgesic effect of pethidine
	+	All of the above
10.	Pethidine causes analgesia by:
	+	Acting on the central nervous system
	-	Acting on the uterine muscle
	-	Acting on the peripheral nerves
	-	Making the patient sleepy so that she is not aware of the pain
11.	What is a dangerous complication of an overdose of pethidine?
	-	Suppression of uterine contractions
	+	Respiratory depression in the patient
	-	Convulsions
	-	Excessive drowsiness
12.	Pethidine and promethazine (Phenergan) or hydroxyzine (Aterax) should only be given if:
	-	The cervical dilatation is 4 cm or less in a multigravida patient
	-	The patient is unlikely to deliver in the next 4 to 6 hours
	-	The intramuscular route is used
	+	It is the most appropriate method of analgesia; the degree of cervical dilatation and the expected time of delivery are of little importance
13.	Pethidine may cause respiratory depression in the newborn infant if:
	-	The drug is given when the patient’s cervix is more than 4 cm dilated
	+	The drug is given less than 6 hours before delivery
	-	More than 50 mg pethidine is given
	-	Promethazine or hydroxyzine is not given together with the pethidine
14.	The duration of action when pethidine is given by intramuscular injection is usually:
	-	1 hour
	-	2 hours
	+	4 hours
	-	8 hours
15.	What is the correct management of a newborn infant who does not breathe well if the mother has been given pethidine during labour?
	-	The infant should be ventilated until the effect of the pethidine wears off.
	-	The infant should be given an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose.
	-	The infant should be given mask oxygen while being stimulated by gently flicking the soles of the feet.
	+	The infant must be ventilated and given naloxone until the effect of the pethidine is reversed.
16.	What is the correct management of a teenager who has not received antenatal care and is unco-operative and frightened during labour?
	-	She should be given a sedative such as diazepam (Valium).
	-	It is best to let her suffer as this will ensure that she does not fall pregnant again in a hurry.
	+	The staff should attempt to communicate with her while the tranquillising effect of promethazine or hydroxyzine and the analgesic effect of pethidine should also help.
	-	The patient should be delivered by Caesarean section to avoid a very difficult vaginal delivery.
17.	Which of the following statements about the nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture (Entonox) is correct?
	+	It is completely safe.
	-	It always provides excellent pain relief.
	-	It may cause respiratory depression in the newborn infant.
	-	Excessive use may cause respiratory depression in the mother.
18.	Which of the following is a complication of an overdose of local anaesthetic?
	-	Respiratory depression in the mother
	-	Respiratory depression in the newborn infant
	+	Convulsions
	-	Nausea and vomiting
19.	What is the maximum dose of 1% lignocaine that can safely be infiltrated locally in a patient of average weight?
	-	50 ml
	-	40 ml
	-	30 ml
	+	20 ml
20.	Why is metoclopramide (Maxalon) given intravenously 15 minutes before a general anaesthetic?
	-	It has a sedative effect on the patient.
	+	Stomach emptying is increased.
	-	It neutralises stomach acid.
	-	It reduces intra-abdominal pressure.
