# Test 2: Monitoring the condition of the fetus during the first stage of labour

1.	Compression of the fetal head during labour:
	+	Usually does not harm the fetus
	-	Usually damages the fetal brain
	-	Usually causes blindness in the newborn infant
	-	Usually kills the fetus
2.	What is the commonest cause of a reduced supply of oxygen to the fetus during labour?
	+	Uterine contractions
	-	Partial placental separation
	-	Placental insufficiency
	-	Infection of the membranes
3.	How does the fetus usually respond to a lack of oxygen during labour?
	-	There is an increase in fetal movements.
	+	There is a decrease in the fetal heart rate.
	-	There is an increase in the fetal heart rate.
	-	There is a decrease in fetal movements.
4.	How should the fetal heart rate be monitored in labour?
	-	A cardiotocograph (CTG machine) should preferably be used in all labours.
	+	A doptone is the preferred method in primary care clinics and hospitals.
	-	A fetal stethoscope is the best method for most labours.
	-	The fetal heart rate does not need to be monitored in all low risk pregnancies.
5.	The fetal heart rate pattern should be monitored:
	-	During a contraction
	-	Before a contraction
	-	After a contraction
	+	Before, during and after a contraction 
6.	How often should the fetal heart rate be monitored during the first stage of labour in low risk pregnancies where there is no meconium staining of the liquor?
	-	Every three hours during the latent phase
	+	Every two hours during the latent phase
	-	Every two hours during the active phase
	-	Every 15 minutes during the active phase
7.	What is the normal baseline fetal heart rate in labour?
	-	100–120 beats per minute
	-	120–140 beats per minute
	-	140–160 beats per minute
	+	100–160 beats per minute
8.	Early decelerations:
	+	Start at the beginning of a contraction and return to the baseline at the end of a contraction
	-	Start at the beginning of a contraction and end 30 seconds or more after the contraction
	-	Do not have any relation to contractions
	-	Occur during the period of uterine relaxation
9.	Early decelerations are usually caused by:
	-	Intracranial haemorrhage
	+	Compression of the fetal head
	-	A short umbilical cord
	-	A decreased supply of oxygen to the fetus
10.	What are late decelerations?
	-	Decelerations that occur after 38 weeks gestation
	-	Decelerations that are only present at the end of the first stage of labour
	-	Decelerations that start 30 seconds or more after the beginning of the contraction
	+	Decelerations that return to the baseline 30 seconds or more after the end of the contraction
11.	Late decelerations:
	+	Always indicate fetal distress
	-	Only suggest that fetal distress may be present
	-	May be normal
	-	Cannot be diagnosed with a fetal stethoscope
12.	A baseline tachycardia:
	-	Indicates that the fetus is in good condition
	-	Is common when the mother is given pethidine
	+	May be caused by infection of the placenta and membranes
	-	Indicates that the fetus is dying from lack of oxygen
13.	A baseline bradycardia:
	-	Is a safe pattern
	-	Is a pattern which indicates an increased risk of fetal distress
	+	Indicates severe fetal distress
	-	Is usually caused by infection of the placenta and membranes
14.	Which fetal heart rate pattern warns that there is an increased risk of fetal distress?
	+	Early decelerations
	-	Late decelerations
	-	Baseline bradycardia
	-	Late decelerations plus a baseline bradycardia
15.	When can you be confident that the fetal condition is good?
	+	When the baseline fetal heart rate is normal and there are no decelerations
	-	When the baseline fetal heart rate is normal and there are only early decelerations
	-	When fetal tachycardia is present and there are no decelerations
	-	All of the above
16.	Meconium staining of the liquor:
	-	Is uncommon
	+	Occurs in 10–20% of patients
	-	Occurs in 30–40% of patients
	-	Occurs in most patients
17.	Meconium staining of the liquor is commonest in:
	+	Patients in postterm labour
	-	Patients in term labour
	-	Patients in preterm labour
	-	Patients whose fetuses move a lot during pregnancy
18.	Which form of meconium in the liquor is most likely to indicate the presence of fetal distress?
	-	Fresh meconium indicates definite fetal distress and is an indication for an emergency Caesarean section
	-	Old meconium indicates that there was a problem but that there is no need to be concerned
	-	Yellow meconium is of no clinical importance
	+	The management is the same as it does not matter what the consistency or colour of the meconium is
19.	Why does a fetus pass meconium during labour?
	+	Because there is fetal hypoxia
	-	Because it makes the second stage of labour shorter
	-	Because the mother has been given liquid paraffin
	-	Because it is mature and ready for delivery
20.	What is the correct management when the liquor is meconium stained?
	+	Monitor the fetal heart rate carefully.
	-	Deliver the fetus immediately by Caesarean section.
	-	Give the patient an oxytocin infusion to shorten labour.
	-	Transfer the patient urgently to a level 3 hospital.
