# Test 1: Introduction to congenital disorders

1.	What is a congenital disorder?
	-	An abnormality of structure present at birth
	-	An abnormality of function present at birth
	+	Either an abnormality of structure or function present at birth
	-	An abnormality of structure or function which is not present at birth
2.	What is birth prevalence?
	+	The number of affected infants per 1000 live births
	-	The number of affected infants per 1000 total births
	-	The number of affected infants born in a month
	-	The number of affected infants born in a year
3.	How common are congenital disorders in developing countries?
	-	10/1000 total births.
	-	30/1000 still births.
	+	80/1000 live births.
	-	120/1000 live births.
4.	How many chromosomes are found in the cells of the human body?
	-	22
	-	23
	-	44
	+	46
5.	Females have:
	-	One X chromosome.
	-	One Y chromosome.
	-	Two X chromosomes.
	-	No X chromosomes.
6.	Ova and sperms are also called sex cells or:
	-	Zygotes.
	-	Embryos.
	+	Gametes.
	-	Genes.
7.	What is a gene?
	+	A small package of DNA.
	-	A group of chromosomes.
	-	A fertilised egg.
	-	A pair of chromosomes.
8.	What are alleles?
	+	A pair of similar genes.
	-	Single chromosomes.
	-	A substance that damages a fetus.
	-	A defect in a single gene.
9.	What is a mutation?
	+	A change in the structure of a gene.
	-	An increased number of genes.
	-	A decreased number of genes.
	-	It has nothing to do with genes.
10.	What is the chance of inheriting a dominant gene present in one parent?
	-	There is a 25% chance of inheriting the gene.
	+	There is a 50% chance of inheriting the gene.
	-	Only females pass on the gene.
	-	Only males pass on the gene.
11.	What is a recessive gene?
	-	A ‘stronger’ gene.
	+	A ‘weaker’ gene.
	-	A female gene.
	-	Always an abnormal gene.
12.	A person who has a dominant and a recessive gene for a particular physical feature or function is called:
	-	A female.
	-	Homozygous.
	+	Heterozygous.
	-	A twin.
13.	If both parents are carriers of a recessive gene, the chance of their infant inheriting both recessive genes is:
	-	1:1 (i.e. 100%).
	-	1:2 (i.e. 50%).
	+	1:4 (i.e. 25%).
	-	1:10 (i.e. 10%).
14.	Name the type of inheritance if a recessive gene is carried by females and only passed on to their male infants:
	-	Dominant inheritance.
	-	Recessive inheritance.
	-	Y-linked inheritance.
	+	X-linked inheritance.
15.	What are multifactorial congenital disorders?
	-	A congenital disorder caused but two or more genetic abnormalities.
	-	A congenital disorder cause by two or more teratogens.
	+	A congenital disorders caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.
	-	A congenital disorder common in twins.
16.	What is a teratogen?
	-	An abnormal chromosome.
	-	An abnormal gene.
	+	Something that damages the embryo or fetus.
	-	Something that damages a gene.
17. What is a malformation?
	+	A congenital disorder which is caused by a problem in the first trimester
	-	A congenital disorder caused by amniotic bands
	-	A congenital disorder caused by hypoxia in labour
	-	A congenital disorder caused by a problem in the last trimester
18.	Which is an example of constraint causing a congenital disorder?
	-	Drinking excess alcohol during pregnancy
	+	Oligohydramnios (too little amniotic fluid)
	-	Wearing tight fitting clothes during pregnancy
	-	Reducing calorie intake in late pregnancy to slow fetal growth
19. What is the name of a pattern of multiple structural abnormalities which can easily be recognized?
	-	An association
	-	A disruption
	+	A syndrome
	-	A deformity
20.	What is a sequence?
	+	One physical abnormality resulting in a number of other abnormalities
	-	Two or more siblings with the same congenital disorder
	-	A number of closely related single gene defects resulting in a congenital disorder
	-	Two or more chromosomes causing a functional congenital disorder
