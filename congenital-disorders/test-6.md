# Test 6: Neural tube defects

1.	What is a neural tube defect?
	-	An abnormality of the peripheral nerves.
	+	A malformation of the neural tube.
	-	A narrowing or absence of the neural tube.
	-	A form of nerve deafness.
2.	Which of the following is an example of a neural tube defect?
	+	Meningomyelocoele.
	-	Omphalocoele.
	-	Microcephaly.
	-	All of the above.
3.	With anencephaly:
	-	The spine is open in the lumbar and sacral region of the back.
	-	Only the membranes bulge out of a defect in the vertebral column.
	-	Both the membranes and spinal cord bulge out of the defect in the vertebral column.
	+	The top of the skull is open and the malformed brain is exposed.
4.	Infants with anencephaly usually:
	+	Die soon after birth.
	-	Are operated on after delivery.
	-	Are only referred for surgery when they are able to walk.
	-	Survive with blindness and deafness.
5.	Which of the following is an open spinal defect?
	-	Spina bifida occulta.
	-	Encephalocoele.
	+	Meningomyelocoele.
	-	Hydrocephalus.
6.	The birth prevalence of neural tube defects in South Africa is:
	-	10–40/1000.	
	+	1–4/1000.	
	-	1/ 10 000.	
	-	4/ 100 000.	
7.	In South Africa, neural tube defects are commoner in:
	-	Urban areas.
	+	Rural areas.
	-	Older mothers.
	-	Teenage mothers.
8.	Most neural tube defects are due to:
	-	Autosomal dominant inheritance.
	-	Autosomal recessive inheritance.
	-	X-linked recessive inheritance.
	+	Multifactorial inheritance.
9.	Neural tube defects may occasionally be caused by:
	-	High doses of folic acid.
	-	Smoking cigarettes.
	+	Some anticonvulsants.
	-	Taking iron supplements during pregnancy.
10.	Common complications of encephalocoele include:
	+	Intellectual disability.
	-	Paralysed legs and bladder incontinence.
	-	Meningitis.
	-	Kyphosis or scoliosis.
11.	Meningomyelocoele commonly results in:
	-	Deafness.
	+	Club feet.
	-	Anencephaly.
	-	Blindness.
12.	Meningocoele usually presents with:
	-	Paralysed legs.
	+	A bulge over the midline of the spine.
	-	Incontinence of bladder and bowel.
	-	Bed sores.
13.	A spina bifida occulta may be recognised by:
	-	A bulge over the lower spine.
	-	A large head at birth.
	+	A patch of hair in the midline of the lower back.
	-	Club feet.
14.	Meningocoele can be corrected with:
	+	Surgery.
	-	Antibiotics.
	-	Neurodevelopmental therapy.
	-	Anticonvulsants.
15.	To reduce the risk of neural tube defects, supplementation should be given:
	+	Three months before and three months after conception.
	-	As soon as pregnancy is diagnosed.
	-	Only after the first trimester.
	-	Throughout the second half of pregnancy.
16.	What dietary fortification can reduce the risk of neural tube defects?
	-	Vitamin A.
	-	Vitamin C.
	+	Folic acid.
	-	Zinc.
17.	What are the risks of a mother having a second child with a neural tube defect?
	-	1%.
	+	5%.
	-	25%.
	-	50%.
18.	Which maternal serum screening test helps to identify pregnant women at increased risk of having a child with neural tube defects?
	-	Alkaline phosphatase.
	-	Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD).
	+	Alpha-fetoprotein.
	-	Ferritin.
19.	Ultrasound screening for neural tube defects is best done at:
	-	10 weeks.
	+	18 weeks.
	-	26 weeks.
	-	36 weeks.
20.	What is the management of a woman who has a fetus with a neural tube defect?
	-	Nothing can be done.
	-	Amniocentesis.
	-	Induction of labour at 36 weeks for early surgery.
	+	Genetic counselling.
