Community Health Workers (CHWs) serve as a very important direct link between patients, communities and health services. As trusted on-the-ground support to community members, they therefore expand access to essential healthcare information as well as available treatment and prevention programmes.
The Mothers and Baby Care for Communities Health Workers course book provides appropriate, cost-effective, and sustainable targeted learning for the large numbers of emerging Community Health Workers in South Africa.
The proven Perinatal Education Programme methodology of decentralised, small group, learning, facilitated by a professional nurse, is ideal to meet the training needs of diverse groups of Community Health Workers, particularly those in under-resourced, remote or rural communities. Bettercare is working alongside health workers to bring this highly successful, easily applied training model to the Community Health Worker development programmes.
This sample group of topics from Mother and Baby Care for Community Health Workers includes:
1.  Care of mothers
2.  Care of newborn babies
3.  Exclusive breastfeeding
4.  HIV in mother and baby
The Community Health Work modules included in this booklet have been successfully used as part of the Skills to Care learning programme for the Lukhanji Municipality and Sarah Baartman District Municipality in the Eastern Cape, funded by the Small Projects Foundation.
Editor: Professor David Woods


## Why decentralised learning? 

Continuing education for health workers traditionally consists of courses and workshops run by formal trainers at large central hospitals. These courses are expensive to attend, often far away from the health workersâ€™ families and places of work, and the content frequently fails to address the biggest healthcare challenges of poor, rural communities.

To help solve these many problems, a self-help decentralised learning method has been developed which addresses the needs of professional healthcare workers, especially those in under-resourced regions.

## Format of the courses

### Objectives

The learning objectives are clearly stated at the start of each chapter. They help the participant to identify and understand the important lessons to be learned.

### Pre- and post-tests

There is a multiple-choice test of 20 questions for each chapter at the end of the book. Participants are encouraged to take a pre-test before starting each chapter to benchmark their current knowledge, and a post-test after each chapter to assess what they have learned. Self-assessment allows participants to monitor their own progress through the course.

### Question-and-answer format

Theoretical knowledge is presented in a question-and-answer format, which encourages the learner to actively participate in the learning process. In this way, the participant is led step by step through the definitions, causes, diagnosis, prevention, dangers and management of a particular problem.

Participants should cover the answer for a few minutes with a piece of paper while thinking about the correct reply to each question. This method helps learning. 

Simplified flow diagrams are also used, where necessary, to indicate the correct approach to diagnosing or managing a particular problem. 

Each question is identified with the number of the chapter, followed by the number of the question, for example 5-23.

> Important practical lessons are emphasised like this.

Note
:	Additional, non-essential information is provided for interest and given in notes like this. These facts are not used in the case studies or included in the multiple-choice questions.

### Case studies

Each chapter closes with a few case studies which encourage the participant to consolidate and apply what was learned earlier in the chapter. These studies give the participant an opportunity to see the problem as it usually presents itself in the clinic or hospital. The participant should attempt to answer each question in the case study before reading the correct answer. Case studies without the correct answers are also used at the start of some chapters to identify common clinical problems that need to be addressed.

### Final examination

On completion of each course, participants can take a 75-question, self-managed multiple-choice examination.

All the exam questions will be taken from the multiple-choice tests from the book. The content of the skills chapters will not be included in the examination.

Participants need to achieve at least 80% in the examination in order to successfully complete the course. Successful candidates will be sent a certificate which states that they have successfully completed that course. South African doctors can earn CPD points on the successful completion of the CPD test at the end of each chapter.

## Updating the course material

Bettercare learning materials are regularly updated to keep up with developments and changes in healthcare protocols. Course participants can make important contributions to the continual improvement of Bettercare books by reporting factual or language errors, by identifying sections that are difficult to understand, and by suggesting additions or improvements to the contents. Details of alternative or better forms of management would be particularly appreciated. Please send any comments or suggestions to the Editor-in-Chief, Professor David Woods.
