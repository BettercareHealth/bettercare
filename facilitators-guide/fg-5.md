# Hints and tips for successful group work

## Keeping participants motivated

Group members need to stay motivated to achieve their goals. When a course runs over a long period of time, it is easy to lose motivation. Here are some ways to keep members motivated.
 
Get group members to keep a learning journal. In their journal they can record what they have learnt and, more importantly, how they have applied their new knowledge and skills in the workplace. They can share these experiences with the group at the beginning or end of each session. Hearing how other people have grown is very motivational, as is seeing your own progress. 

Keep a record of the group members’ post-test scores on the multiple-choice tests. You can have a ‘top achiever’ every week or every two weeks. Name the top achiever and let the group congratulate him or her. To make it fun, you could have a special sign that the top achiever wears that week, for example, a funny hat or a big badge.

With the group’s permission, display the pre- and post-test scores on the multiple-choice tests on the wall of your meeting room. You could also have a weekly or bi-weekly award for the most improved participant.  

When you have a monitoring discussion, remind the group of the goals you set together at the beginning of the process. As a group, talk about how far you are in meeting those goals, and if any of those goals have changed. 

## Keeping it interesting

Participants stay motivated when what they are learning is presented in an interesting way and when they feel they are part of the process. 

Here are some more ideas to keep participants interested: 

* Create slideshows of the key points in the chapter. Include photos, images, graphs, video clips, sound bites, newspaper clippings, etc.
* Show and tell: If you can, bring examples of items discussed in the chapter, such as empty medicine containers, equipment, X-rays, etc.
* Bring in help: You can arrange for experienced medical or nursing colleagues to visit your hospital or NGO and do demonstrations or ten-minute lessons covering a section.
* Case studies: Ask one group member each week to prepare a case study from one of their actual patients for everyone else in the group to learn from.
* Play acting: You can ask group members to play out nurse–patient scenarios described in the book, and then get feedback from the rest of the group members on what was done 	correctly, and what could have been done better.
	
Remember to include all group members in presenting information to the group. For example, the participants can take turns to present case studies from their own experience, or they can help with preparation by bringing the necessary equipment for demonstrations or identifying and inviting resource people to present to the group. Remember that each member of the group contributes to the success of the group as a whole. At the same time, they are all responsible for their own learning.

## Ensuring skills are applied in the work setting

There is not much point in learning new knowledge and skills if it isn’t applied in the work setting. Here are some ways to make sure new knowledge and skills are carried over into ‘real life’. 

* Each member keeps a learning journal or diary and writes down experiences they have had in the workplace where they had the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills. These can be shared at the beginning or end of each session. 
* The members of the group can share at the beginning or end of each session what they have noticed their colleagues doing differently after training. This also helps to develop problem-solving and decision-making skills.  
* The group members can share experiences they had before training and talk about what they would do differently now that they have new knowledge and skills. 
* Ask a superior or co-workers if they have noticed a change in the group members’ professional behaviour and attitudes. Emphasise that you are not ‘checking up on them’. You are gathering information to find out if the learning process is successful. 
* If the material in the course is different to hospital or clinic policy, discuss this in the group. Try to reach a compromise after reviewing both points of view.
