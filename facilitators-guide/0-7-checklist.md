# Checklists

## Before the first group meeting

☐&emsp;Identify  needs for training at your institution.  
☐&emsp;Decide which need is the most urgent (you can get input from other staff members here).  
☐&emsp;Choose an appropriate Bettercare course.  
☐&emsp;Draw up a training budget.  
☐&emsp;Get stakeholder buy-in.  
☐&emsp;Advertise the course.  
☐&emsp;Hold a preliminary information session about the Bettercare course you will run.  
☐&emsp;Sign up group members (about 5–10) and get their contact details.  
☐&emsp;Organise how you will read the books (online for free or order print versions).  
☐&emsp;Contact everyone to say when and where the first official meeting will be held.  
☐&emsp;Start a ‘Facilitator’s File’ (a flip-file is an easy and neat option) where you keep copies of templates, notes and important documents.  

## At the first group meeting

☐&emsp;Let group members introduce themselves.  
☐&emsp;Introduce and discuss what decentralised learning means.  
☐&emsp;Make group rules that everyone agrees with.  
☐&emsp;Establish goals that everyone shares.  
☐&emsp;Explain how the learning programme works.  
☐&emsp;Explain your role in the group (not a teacher, but a facilitator).  
☐&emsp;Decide how, when and where future group meetings will happen.  
☐&emsp;Decide if you will write the exam at the end of the course (you can change your mind).  
☐&emsp;Choose a treasurer (who will monitor the budget and finances).  

## Before every group meeting

☐&emsp;All group members must read the relevant chapter.  
☐&emsp;Create the lesson plan (see Chapter 4: How to run a Bettercare group).  
☐&emsp;Make sure you have all the resources you need for the meeting.  
☐&emsp;Organise someone to demonstrate the skill if needed.  
☐&emsp;Send out a reminder SMS to all group members of session venue and time.  

## At group meetings

☐&emsp;Discuss difficult sections of the chapter you have all studied the previous week.  
☐&emsp;Go through the chapter case studies.  
☐&emsp;Have a demonstration and discussion of the relevant skill.  
☐&emsp;Everyone does the post-test for the chapter you have studied and discussed.  
☐&emsp;Everyone marks and records the pre- and post-tests.  
☐&emsp;Everyone completes the pre-test for the next chapter.  

## After completing the chapters

☐&emsp;Decide who will write the exam (including yourself).  
☐&emsp;Email exams@bettercare.co.za to request as many exams as you need.  
☐&emsp;If you will be writing the exam, organise an exam invigilator.  
☐&emsp;Write the one-hour, 75-question exam.  
☐&emsp;Notify Bettercare of the participants’ results.  
☐&emsp;Receive certificates.  
☐&emsp;If 50% of your group are successful in the exam, you will receive a facilitator’s certificate.  
☐&emsp;Arrange a certificate handover ceremony if possible.  
☐&emsp;Take a group photo and send to info@bettercare.co.za.
