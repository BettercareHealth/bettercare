# Starting a Bettercare group

## Group meeting times

The first thing you need to decide on once you have formed a group is what time the group will meet. Group sessions should be at regular intervals and often enough to keep participants focused and on track. 

We recommend that each meeting concerns one chapter of the book and that these meetings happen once a week or once every two weeks. 

Although group meetings need to be regular, you should be flexible. People’s work schedules may change, or they may have other commitments that come up. You should find a way to communicate with all group members about changing meeting times and venues. SMS messages are a convenient way to do this, so make sure you have everyone’s cellphone numbers (find a template ‘Group Contact List’ at the end of this guide).

Remember the group should decide together on a meeting time that suits everyone and fits into your work schedule. If you have 10 or more people wanting to do the course, you can split the group in two and have two different meeting times (e.g. a morning group and an afternoon group). 

You will also need to get permission from the authorities at your institution if the group meeting time is during working hours or if you want to use a venue at work for the meetings.

## How to get copies of the books

* You can read all our books online for free at: ls.bettercare.co.za. Simply click on the book you would like to read and start learning.
* You can order print versions of all our books by emailing: sales@bettercare.co.za.   
* All our books are also available as ebooks on Amazon (www.amazon.com)

## Identifying resources and material

Some of our books include skills workshops. These work best if you have someone who knows the skill well to demonstrate it to the group. There should also be an opportunity for the group members to practise the skill at the group meeting. 

The first step is to identify a person who has that particular skill and is willing to demonstrate it to the group. This could be an experienced co-worker, a visiting mentor or someone from a different job category. It is more convenient if the person is from the same institution as yourself, but if that is not possible, you can invite someone from a nearby health facility. When you invite someone, you need to be clear about what they have to do. Give/send them a copy of the skills workshop they will be covering, and remember to give them clear information about the time and place of the meeting, preferably in writing. If you like, you can give the demonstrator a small gift to show your appreciation. A card signed by the group members is meaningful and doesn’t cost a lot of money.

Often the skills workshops require equipment or other resources for the demonstration (e.g. medical equipment, a dummy or medical charts). Make a list of these requirements in advance and make a plan to ensure you have all the necessary resources for a successful workshop. You can delegate this task to someone in the group. Group members can take turns to get the resources together for the skills workshops. 

## A training budget

If you have to buy books for the group members, you will need to make a budget. Some hospitals and clinics will pay for learning materials for their staff, but you need to give them a clear budget for how much the materials will cost and any other costs you might have. 

If you need a formal quote for books, please contact us at sales@bettercare.co.za or call us at 021 671 1278 and we will give you a formal estimate. If the participants have to buy their own books, you can give them information about how much the books will cost, collect the money and order and pay for the books at once. 

However, you do not need to buy the books to do a Bettercare course because you can read all our books online, for free at: ls.bettercare.co.za. You only need to pay if you want to write the exam at the end of the course to get a certificate.

You might have other costs besides the books. If you want to have refreshments at your meetings, you need to put this in the budget you submit to your institution. You can delegate the task of buying the refreshments to different group members each week. If you want to give a small gift to the people who demonstrate the skills workshops or if you need to pay for their transport, this also needs to be in the budget. 

Airtime for facilitator will also need to be in the budget as you need to be able to contact the group members at least once a week.

Photocopying and printing needs to also be in the budget as there are various materials which need to be printed or photocopied for each meeting.

As the Group Facilitator, you do not have to manage the finances. The group can choose someone who likes working with numbers to manage money and the training budget. Group finances should be transparent: this means that everyone in the group should know how much money is in the budget and how it is being spent. Always keep till slips, invoices and a record of all expenses.

## Establishing goals

Establish everyone’s goals for the course during the first meeting. An easy way to do this is for each person to introduce themselves and then give a brief explanation of their work day, and what they hope to learn during this course. You can then select two or three of the common goals and write them down for easy reference as the course goes on. It helps to motivate participants if the goals are written down on a large piece of paper or cardboard and stuck on the wall of the training room. 

Each group member may like to write down their own, personal goals for the course, and keep track of how they are progressing in achieving their goal. You can use the template at the end of this guide to record your group and personal goals.
