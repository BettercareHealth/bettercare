# Dear Group Leader

We’ve developed this guide to help you with training groups of health workers and community health workers.

Group learning is a great way for several people to update their knowledge and skills and learn from each other. But it requires one person to take responsibility for making sure that the group meets regularly, that people stay on track, and that the group makes progress. Your role in the group learning process is vital to the success of this course.

Your role is not to teach or tutor the members of the group. Each member of the group takes responsibility for their own learning. But, you need to support and encourage each person to participate in the group sessions, so that they can contribute towards the learning and understanding of the others. You also need to make sure that everything is in place so that your group’s sessions can be interesting and productive. This guide will help you do just that.

In this guide, you will find out:  

* what group work means
* how to start a group
* how to plan a group 
* how to run a group
* how to keep participants motivated
* how to ensure learning is applied in the work setting
* how to end the course or courses appropriately.

At the end of this guide, you will find some useful templates to use in planning and running your group.    

This guide is for you, and we would like it to be as useful to you as possible. If there is anything we can do to make this guide better, please let us know.

If you have any questions or need help with any aspect of the group learning process, please contact Bettercare on info@bettercare.co.za.

Yours faithfully

The Bettercare Team
