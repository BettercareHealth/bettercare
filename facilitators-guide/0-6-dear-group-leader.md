# Dear Bettercare Group Leader

We’ve developed this guide to help you with training groups of health workers using the Bettercare self-managed training material.

Group learning is a great way for several people to update their knowledge and skills and learn from each other. However, it requires one person to take responsibility for making sure that the group meets regularly, that people stay on track, and that the group makes progress: this is your role.

Your role is not to teach or tutor the members of the group. Each member of the group takes responsibility for their own learning. But, you need to support and encourage each person to participate in the group sessions, so that they can contribute towards the learning and understanding of the others. You also need to make sure that everything is in place so that your group’s sessions can be interesting and productive. 

In this guide, you will find out:  

* what group work means
* how to plan a Bettercare group
* how to start a Bettercare group 
* how to run a  Bettercare group
* how to keep participants motivated
* how to ensure learning is applied in the work setting
* how to end the course or courses appropriately

We want this Facilitator's Guide to be user-friendly: On the next page you will find a summarised checklist showing exactly which steps to take when. At the end of this guide, you will find some useful templates to use in planning and running your group. 

Being a successful Bettercare Group Facilitator requires taking initiative and leadership skills. Because of this, we want to reward our facilitator’s for the important role they play in the empowerment and training of healthcare workers. If more than half (50%) of your group members who write the exam qualify for a certificate, we will also mail you a Bettercare Group Facilitator certificate acknowledging your leadership capability and commitment to a goal. You can earn one of these certificates for each different Bettercare course that you facilitate (e.g. one for Newborn Care and another one for Childhood HIV).

If you have any questions or need help with any aspect of the group learning process, please contact Bettercare on info@bettercare.co.za.

Yours faithfully

The Bettercare Team
