# How to run a group

## Establishing group rules

In your first meeting, you will need to establish some group rules. It’s best if the group members decide on the rules together. Ask the group members to give you some ideas of group rules. Discuss these and write them down. Some examples could be:

* regular attendance
* respect different opinions and viewpoints
* listen to others in the group
* don’t interrupt or talk over other group members
* debate is good, arguing is not
* prepare for group sessions
* participate in group discussions by listening and sharing.
	
Write the rules down on a large piece of paper and display them on the wall if possible (you can put the rules up at the beginning of the session and take them down at the end). 

## How the course works

In the first meeting, the group must read through the introduction carefully. Take time to discuss:

* what decentralised on-site learning is
* your role in the group
* how the course and book works. 

## How the book works

### Objectives

These are listed at the beginning of each chapter. They highlight the important lessons to be learned in the chapter.

### Pre- and post-tests

There is a multiple-choice test of 20 questions for each chapter provided at the end of the book. Participants do the test before studying each chapter, and again after they have studied the chapter. When both tests have been completed each participant should look up the correct answers and mark their own pre- and post test. If any answers are wrong, participants should study those sections of the chapter again and repeat the test before moving on to the next chapter. Discuss the difficult sections in the group. Each chapter needs to be studied and mastered before moving on to the next chapter. 

Group members should keep track of their pre- and post-test results to track their learning. It is important that participants take responsibility for assessing their own progress through the book.

### Question-and-answer format

The theoretical knowledge in the book is presented in a question-and-answer format. This method makes learning easy and helps participants play an active role in the learning process. Participants should cover the answer for a few minutes while they think about the correct reply to the question. First thinking of the possible answer helps the learning process. 

Simple flow diagrams are also used to show the correct approach to diagnosing or managing a particular problem. 

### Important lessons and key concepts

Important lessons and key concepts are shown by a dotted frame and writing in bold:

> *Important lessons are shown like this.*

### Notes

Notes, in smaller writing, give non-essential information. This is for the participants’ interest. These facts are not used in the case studies or multiple-choice tests and exam. 

Note
:	Notes are shown like this.
	
### Case studies

Each chapter ends with a few case studies. These help participants to consolidate and apply what they have learnt. The case studies give the participant the opportunity to see a problem as it usually presents itself in the clinic or hospital. Encourage participants to try and answer each question in the case study before they read the correct answer. 

### Practical training

Some chapters contain ‘skills workshops’. These are most effective if the practical skill is demonstrated by an experienced colleague who has already mastered that particular skill. You will have to arrange a suitable time and venue for the demonstration. Different colleagues may be needed to help with the various skills workshops as a single colleague may not have all the skills. Skills workshops are not examined in the final exam, but you may want to arrange your own tests moderated by a senior medical or nursing colleague.

### Final examination

When participants have finished the course, they can take a 75-question multiple-choice exam and, if they pass, receive a certificate of completion. 

## Establishing goals

Establish everyone’s goals for the course during the first meeting. An easy way to do this is for each person to introduce themselves and then give a brief explanation of their work day, and what they hope to learn during this course. You can then select two or three of the common goals and write them down for easy reference as the course goes on. It helps to motivate participants if the goals are written down on a large piece of paper or cardboard and stuck on the wall of the training room. 

Each group member may like to write down their own, personal goals for the course, and keep track of how they are progressing in achieving their goal. You can use the template at the end of this guide to record your goals.

## Planning for group sessions

It’s helpful to have a predictable structure for each group session. You can do this by making a simple lesson plan. A lesson plan is a list of the steps you will follow in the session. The main parts of a lesson plan are:

* an introduction that describes why the lesson is important or useful
* the learning objectives
* a schedule or list showing the order of activities
* a list of resources needed for the lesson
* a description of what needs to be prepared in advance
* the time each activity should take.
	
You can see an example of a lesson plan on the next page. 

Keep your lesson plan short and simple. You can use the lesson plan template at the end of this guide to help you plan your lessons. 

## Identifying and inviting resource people

Occasionally you will need to invite a co-worker to give a demonstration or a talk to the group. Get to know the various health professionals who work in the same area you are studying at your own facility and at nearby clinics and hospitals. You can ask co-workers to refer you to people who have helped them in the past or who are particularly knowledgeable. Make a note of these people and their contact details in your diary or facilitator’s file. You can use the template at the end of this guide to keep a record.

You can contact resource people via email, phone or in person. It is often better to speak to someone in person or on the phone, so you can answer any questions they might have and give them a clear explanation of what you need them to do. 

When you invite someone, you need to be clear about what they have to do. Give them a copy of the skills workshop they will be covering, and remember to give them clear information about the time and place of the meeting. Write it down for them if necessary. Give the resource person a reminder phone call the day before.

If you like, you can give the demonstrator a small gift to show your appreciation. A card signed by the members of the group is meaningful and doesn’t cost a lot of money.

## Preparing for group sessions

Each member of the group studies the material that is going to be covered before the session. They also complete the pre-test. You must study the material and complete the pre-test yourself, too. The group members can make a list of questions they would like to discuss and note any sections they found difficult. 

Make sure you have everything you will need in the session, for example, equipment you need for the demonstrations. 

## Using the multiple-choice tests

Participants do the test before studying each chapter (pre-test), and again after they have studied the chapter (post test). When both tests have been completed each participant should look up the correct answers and mark their own pre- and post test. If any answers are wrong, participants should study those sections of the chapter again and repeat the test before moving on to the next chapter.

Discuss the pre- and post-test results in the group. They will help you to identify which sections need more work. 

You can photocopy the multiple-choice test answer sheets at the end of this guide.
