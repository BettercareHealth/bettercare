# Introduction to working in groups

## What is group learning?

Small group learning  is an ideal way for people to learn from each other, test out new knowledge and clinical skills, practise teamwork and improve their people skills. Learning in a group is about teamwork. It is about moving forward and helping others move forward with us. 

We have all worked in groups before. At home, we work as a group to keep the house clean and to prepare meals. At school, we worked in groups to complete projects. At college or university, we may have worked in groups to complete assignments or prepare for exams. We know from these experiences that every member of the group has an effect on the other members of the group. We also know that in every team, someone needs to be there to lead the others, making it easier for the group to make progress and keep on track. This is the role of the facilitator. 

## Advantages of collaborative learning

Learning in a group is called collaborative learning. Collaborative learning helps people develop:

* interpersonal skills (people skills)
* problem-solving skills
* presentation skills
* communication skills
* listening skills
* an appreciation for other people’s views
	
These are all difficult to learn on your own, and they are important skills to have in the healthcare profession. 

Collaborative learning also allows members of the group to question and challenge their beliefs, values and assumptions and develop a deeper understanding of the topic. If you understand a topic more deeply, it is easier to apply your learning in different situations. 

## What does the facilitator do?

The facilitator is not a tutor. You will not be teaching the group members. They should be taking responsibility for their own learning, and working through the chapters on their own. Your role is to make it easier for them to talk about and understand concepts they struggle with, share their knowledge and experience, and to make sure all the practical arrangements are taken care of. Imagine that the group is a machine. Each member of the group is a different part of that machine. You are a part of that machine: you are the steering wheel, giving the group direction, and you are also the grease that keeps the machine running smoothly.  

Ideally, managing and facilitating courses should be part of your routine duties in your setting. For this, you will need to get the permission of the authorities at your clinic or hospital. 

## Effective small groups

Some groups are better at getting things done than others. An effective small group:

* is a group of people whose knowledge, experience and skills may differ but still complement each other
* who collaborate with one another
* to achieve a common goal
* for which they are accountable together. 
	
You can see that all members of the group need to “buy in” to the process. They need to be committed to the goals of the group and be accountable for their actions in the group. 

## Successful collaborative learning

There are four important elements for successful collaborative learning:

* Trust – members must feel safe in the group
* Sharing – members must feel able to share their knowledge, skills and experience with the rest of the group
* Interdependence – members must work together to achieve the goals of the group
* Accountability – each member of the group must contribute to the process, or the group will not meet its goals. 

## Stages of group work

Working in a group can be tough. Social researchers have spent many years studying different kinds of groups and how they work. They have found that almost every group goes through four stages:

* norming – the group establishes a leader or facilitator and group members try to find out more about each other
* storming – initially there may be difficulties between group members or between members and the facilitator
* forming – members of the group trust each other more and rules might develop to guide the group and prevent arguments in future
* performing – this is the productive period where the group is focused on its goal; members have more confidence and the facilitator only guides the process. 

As the facilitator, it is useful to understand these four stages and not to be discouraged when things are difficult at first. Most groups move successfully to a stage where they are focused and productive.
