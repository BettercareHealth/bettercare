# Dear Facilitator

We’ve developed this guide to help you run a Bettercare learning programme in a study group.

Group learning is a great way for people to update their knowledge and skills and learn from each other. However, it requires one person to take responsibility for making sure that the group meets regularly, that people stay on track, and that the group makes progress: this is your role.

Your role is not to teach or tutor the members of the group. Each member of the group takes responsibility for their own learning. But you need to support and encourage each person to participate in the group sessions, so that they can contribute towards the learning and understanding of the others. You also need to make sure that everything is in place so that your group’s sessions can be interesting and productive. 

In this guide, you will learn about:  

* what makes group work powerful
* starting your group and getting support
* goal-setting and managing finances
* managing group meetings and tests
* keeping participants motivated
* exams, certificates and ceremonies
* measuring the impact of learning on your daily work.

To help you get started, you'll find:

* checklists showing exactly which steps to take when
* template forms for planning and running your group.

This guide describes the best way to run a Bettercare study group, but we understand that it will take practise to develop all the skills of a great facilitator. You may not get everything right the first time, but don't let that stop you from running more courses. The most important thing is that your study group is supportive of the learning process.

> It takes practise to develop all the skills of a great facilitator.

Being a good facilitator requires initiative and leadership skills. Because of this, we want to reward our facilitators for the important role they play in the empowerment and training of healthcare workers. If more than half of your group members who write the exam qualify for a certificate, we will also mail you a Bettercare Facilitator certificate acknowledging your leadership capability and commitment to a goal. You can earn one of these certificates for each different Bettercare course that you facilitate (e.g. one for Newborn Care and another one for Childhood HIV).

If you have any questions or need help with any aspect of the group learning process, please contact us. You can email <info@bettercare.co.za> or call +27 21 671 1278.

Best wishes

The Bettercare Team
