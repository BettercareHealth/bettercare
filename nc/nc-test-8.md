# Test 8: Glucose control and hypoglycaemia

Glucose is stored in the body as glycogen in:
	- The brain
	- The red blood cells
	- The liver `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Fat
In the healthy newborn infant the blood glucose concentration is:
	- Lower than a normal adult `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- The same as a normal adult
	- Higher than a normal adult
	- Higher than a normal child
The normal blood glucose concentration in a newborn infant is:
	- Less than 2.0 mmol/l
	- 2.0 mmol/l to 7.0 mmol/l `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- 1.5 mmol/l to 10.0 mmol/l
	- 7.0 mmol/l to 15 mmol/l
The definition of severe hypoglycaemia is a blood glucose concentration:
	- Less than 7.0 mmol/l
	- Less than 5.0 mmol/l
	- Less than 2.0 mmol/l
	- Less than 1.5 mmol/l `correct`{:.correct-answer}
Hypoglycaemia is dangerous as it may cause:
	- Jaundice
	- Brain damage `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Anaemia
	- Bleeding
Which of the following problems is likely to cause hypoglycaemia because the infant has an increased breakdown of glucose?
	- A skin temperature below 36°C `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- An intraventricular haemorrhage
	- Jaundice
	- Bruising
The following infants are at high risk of hypoglycaemia as they have increased energy (glucose) requirements:
	- Infants with recurrent apnoea
	- Infants born after 37 weeks gestation
	- Infants with respiratory distress `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Infants with jaundice
Infants born to diabetic women are at risk of hypoglycaemia because they commonly have:
	- Increased secretion of insulin `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Decreased secretion of insulin
	- No secretion of insulin
	- No pancreas
The following infants are at an increased risk of hypoglycaemia:
	- Female infants
	- Male infants
	- Wasted infants `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Term infants
Hypoglycaemia:
	- Always presents with clinical signs.
	- Never presents with clinical signs.
	- May present with clinical signs. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Usually kills the infant.
Hypoglycaemia may present with:
	- Jaundice
	- Convulsions `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Pyrexia
	- Oedema
What should be given as the first feed to a healthy, preterm infant of 1850g?
	- Sterile water
	- A milk feed `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- A 5% glucose feed
	- A 50% glucose feed
To prevent hypoglycaemia you should routinely start feeding term infants:
	- Immediately after delivery `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- At 1 hour after delivery
	- At 3 hours after delivery
	- At 6 hours after delivery
If a newborn infant had severe hypoglycaemia in a rural clinic with very limited facilities, which form of treatment should you give?
	- Give a feed of 50% dextrose.
	- Give a feed of cow’s milk and sugar if the mother has no breast milk. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Not feed the infant but send the mother and infant to the nearest hospital for an intravenous infusion.
	- Advise the mother to take the infant home.
Severe hypoglycaemia in a preterm infant is best treated by:
	- Feeding the infant with breast milk
	- Giving 5% dextrose by nasogastric tube
	- Giving an intravenous bolus of 25% dextrose
	- Starting an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose `correct`{:.correct-answer}
In hospital you are unable to find a suitable vein to start an intravenous infusion in a 4000?g infant of a diabetic woman. The infant has severe hypoglycaemia. Would you:
	- Pass an umbilical vein catheter and start a 10% dextrose solution? `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Give a 5% dextrose feed?
	- Cool the infant to conserve energy?
	- Start antibiotics?
If an infant develops severe hypoglycaemia you should:
	- Repeat the blood glucose measurement in 30 minutes to assess whether it has improved.
	- Treat the hypoglycaemia immediately. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Refer the infant to the nearest newborn intensive care (level 3) unit.
	- Try to contact a more senior staff member to treat the infant.
In an infant being treated for severe hypoglycaemia, when should regular blood glucose concentration measurements with reagent strips be stopped?
	- Once the intravenous dextrose infusion is started
	- As soon as the blood glucose concentration returns to normal
	- Only after 5 days
	- When the infant has been weaned from intravenous dextrose to milk feeds `correct`{:.correct-answer}
A very high blood glucose concentration:
	- Helps the infant to grow rapidly.
	- Causes glycosuria which may result in the infant becoming dehydrated. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Is common in newborn infants of diabetic mothers.
	- Is caused by feeding the infant too frequently.
Hyperglycaemia as a complication of an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose or Neonatalyte is usually seen in:
	- Wasted infants
	- Preterm infants `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Postterm infants
	- Infected infants
