	1.	An intraventricular haemorrhage
	1.	Jaundice
	1.	Bruising

	1.	Infants born after 37 weeks gestation
	1.	Infants with respiratory distress{:.correct-answer}
	1.	Infants with jaundice
8.	Infants born to diabetic women are at risk of hypoglycaemia because they commonly have:
	1.	Increased secretion of insulin{:.correct-answer}

	1.	No secretion of insulin
	1.	No pancreas
9.	The following infants are at an increased risk of hypoglycaemia:

	1.	Immediately after delivery{:.correct-answer}
	1.	At 1 hour after delivery
	1.	At 3 hours after delivery
	1.	At 6 hours after delivery
14.	If a newborn infant had severe hypoglycaemia in a rural clinic with very limited facilities, which form of treatment should you give?
	1.	Give a feed of 50% dextrose.
	1.	Give a feed of cow’s milk and sugar if the mother has no breast milk.{:.correct-answer}
	1.	Not feed the infant but send the mother and infant to the nearest hospital for an intravenous infusion.
	1.	Advise the mother to take the infant home.
15.	Severe hypoglycaemia in a preterm infant is best treated by:
	1.	Feeding the infant with breast milk

	1.	Giving an intravenous bolus of 25% dextrose
	1.	Starting an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose{:.correct-answer}
16.	In hospital you are unable to find a suitable vein to start an intravenous infusion in a 4000?g infant of a diabetic woman. The infant has severe hypoglycaemia. Would you:

	1.	Give a 5% dextrose feed?
	1.	Cool the infant to conserve energy?
	1.	Start antibiotics?

	1.	Treat the hypoglycaemia immediately.{:.correct-answer}
	1.	Refer the infant to the nearest newborn intensive care (level 3) unit.
	1.	Try to contact a more senior staff member to treat the infant.
18.	In an infant being treated for severe hypoglycaemia, when should regular blood glucose concentration measurements with reagent strips be stopped?
	1.	Once the intravenous dextrose infusion is started
	1.	As soon as the blood glucose concentration returns to normal
	1.	Only after 5 days
	1.	When the infant has been weaned from intravenous dextrose to milk feeds{:.correct-answer}
19.	A very high blood glucose concentration:
	1.	Helps the infant to grow rapidly.
