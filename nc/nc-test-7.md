	- With an appropriate weight for gestational age
	- Overweight for gestational age
	- At term
What type of subcutaneous fat prevents heat loss?

	- White fat `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Yellow fat
	- Pink fat
Hypothermia is defined as a skin temperature below:
	- 37°C
	- 36°C `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- 30°C
	- 25°C
What determines the correct incubator temperature?
	- The infant’s weight `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- The infant’s sex
	- The infant’s haemoglobin concentration
	- The Apgar score

	- When the body temperature is above normal.
	- When the body temperature is normal. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- When the body temperature is below normal.
	- The oxygen and energy requirements are not influenced by body temperature.
Heat loss by radiation is best prevented by:
	- Woollen booties
	- Woollen leggings
	- A woollen jacket
	- A woollen cap `correct`{:.correct-answer}
How should a well newborn infant with a gestational age of 35 weeks and weighing 1500 g be nursed?
