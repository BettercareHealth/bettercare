# Test 11: Oxygen therapy

Metabolism requiring oxygen is called:
	- Oxidation
	- Anaerobic metabolism
	- Anabolic metabolism
	- Aerobic metabolism `correct`{:.correct-answer}
Most oxygen is carried in the blood by:
	- The red blood cells `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- The white blood cells
	- The platelets
	- The serum
What is the normal concentration of oxygen in room air?
	- 20%
	- 21% `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- 22%
	- 30%
The amount of oxygen carried in the blood can be accurately determined by: 
	- Deciding whether the tongue is pink or cyanosed
	- Measuring the flow of oxygen into the head box
	- Using a pulse oximeter `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Using an oxygen monitor
What is the abbreviation for the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood?
	- PaO₂ `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- SaO₂
	- FiO₂
	- O₂
What is the normal partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood of a healthy newborn infant?
	- 6–8 kPa
	- 8–10 kPa `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- 10–12 kPa
	- 12–20 kPa
What is the normal oxygen saturation in the arterial blood of a newborn infant?
	- 80–86%
	- 86–92% `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- 92–95%
	- 95–100%
When oxygen is given to infants it is usually blended with:
	- Nitrogen
	- Air `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Carbon dioxide
	- Hydrogen
Lack of enough oxygen in inspired air may:
	- Damage the airways.
	- Damage the red cells.
	- Damage the brain. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- None of the above.
Extra oxygen should be given to:
	- All infants at birth
	- All infants under 1500 g
	- All infants with peripheral cyanosis
	- All infants with central cyanosis `correct`{:.correct-answer}
What is a safe concentration of inspired oxygen?
	- 0.40 (i.e. 40%)
	- 0.25 (i.e. 25%)
	- 0.10 (i.e. 10%)
	- Any FiO₂ that gives a normal partial pressure or normal saturation of oxygen in the blood `correct`{:.correct-answer}
Excess oxygen in the inspired air may cause:
	- Deafness
	- Blindness `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Paralysis
	- Mental retardation
Retinopathy of prematurity is usually seen:
	- In underweight for gestational age infants
	- In preterm infants `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- In infants who have been removed from oxygen too soon
	- In infants who have not been given extra oxygen
Retinopathy of prematurity can be largely prevented by:
	- Carefully controlling the PaO₂ or SaO₂ `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Never giving extra oxygen
	- Never giving 100% oxygen
	- Humidifying the oxygen
100% oxygen may damage the infant and therefore:
	- Should never be given to any infant
	- Should not be given for more than 24 hours
	- Should only be given if a lower concentration of oxygen fails to correct central cyanosis `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Should never be given to a preterm infant
Oxygen given via an endotracheal tube should be:
	- Cooled and humidified
	- Warmed and humidified `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Sterilised
	- Warmed only
Extra oxygen is best given into:
	- A head box `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- An incubator
	- A face mask
	- A nasogastric tube
The concentration of oxygen given to an infant is best controlled by:
	- Using a venturi or blender `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Altering the flow rate
	- Altering the size of the head box
	- Increasing or decreasing the amount of water in the humidifier
To increase the concentration of oxygen that an infant is receiving:
	- Decrease the alarm limit on the oxygen monitor.
	- Increase the alarm limit on the oxygen monitor.
	- Decrease the fraction of oxygen given.
	- Increase the fraction of oxygen given. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
The amount of extra oxygen given into a headbox should be measured:
	- As a flow rate (e.g. 5 litres per minute)
	- As a partial pressure (e.g. 5 kPa)
	- As a fraction (e.g. FiO₂ 0.5)
	- As a weight (e.g. 500 g) `correct`{:.correct-answer}
