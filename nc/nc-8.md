# Glucose control and hypoglycaemia

Before you begin this unit, please take the corresponding test to assess your knowledge of the subject matter. You should redo the test after you’ve worked through the unit, to evaluate what you have learned.

## Objectives

* When you have completed this unit you should be able to:
* Explain why the body needs glucose.
* Define hypoglycaemia.
* List the dangers of hypoglycaemia.
* Diagnose hypoglycaemia.
* Identify infants at risk of hypoglycaemia.
* Prevent and treat hypoglycaemia.
* Discuss the causes and management of hyperglycaemia.

## Glucose control

### 8-1 What is glucose?

Glucose is a simple sugar. It is obtained from the diet by the breakdown of more complex carbohydrates (such as starch) and from the conversion of other dietary sugars (such as lactose in milk). Fat and protein in the diet can also be converted by the liver into glucose. Glucose is an essential source of energy to many cells of the body, especially the brain. Glucose is absorbed from the gut and stored in the body as:

1. Glycogen in the liver
2. Protein in muscles
3. Fat under the skin

Glycogen, protein and fat form the body’s energy stores. They can all be converted back into glucose by the liver if needed.

The amount of glucose available to the cells can be assessed by measuring the concentration of glucose in the blood. Glucose is the same as dextrose.

Note
:	The fetus gets most of its energy from the mother in the form of glucose which crosses the placenta. The higher the mother’s blood glucose concentration, the more glucose the fetus will receive.

### 8-2 How is glucose measured in the blood?

The concentration of blood glucose can be measured by different methods:

1. The quickest, cheapest and easiest method in the nursery to measure the blood glucose concentration is to use a reagent strip such as Haemo-Glukotest (Dextrostix is no longer available). The colour of the reagent strip is then compared to the colour range on the bottle to determine the blood glucose concentration. Unfortunately reading the result by eye is not reliable while reagent strips may give a false low reading if the method is not done correctly.
2. A more accurate method to screen for hypoglycaemia is to use a glucose meter (a reflectance meter) such as reading Haemo-Glukotest strips with a Reflolux meter or AccuChek Active strips with a Glucotrend meter or AccuChek Active meter. This is much better than simply reading the reagent strip by eye. It is essential that the correct meter is used with the reagent strips designed for that meter.
3. In a laboratory the serum glucose concentration can be measured using a more complicated method. The laboratory method is more accurate than reagent strips but takes longer, is more expensive and requires more blood.

> The blood glucose concentration in the nursery is usually measured with a reagent strip and a glucose meter.

### 8-3 What is the normal concentration of glucose in the blood?

The normal concentration of glucose in the blood of newborn infants is 2.0 mmol/l (35 mg/dl) to 7.0 mmol/l (120 mg/dl). This is called normoglycaemia (normo = normal; glycaemia = blood glucose). Most newborn infants have a blood glucose concentration in the middle of the normal range, about 3 to 5 mmol/l. The normal range for older children and adults is higher than this. It is preferable to use the metric units of mmol/l rather than the old units of mg/dl.

Note that the normal blood glucose concentration, as measured with reagent strips, is 0.5 mmol/l lower than the serum glucose concentration, as measured in the laboratory.

> The normal range of blood glucose concentration in newborn infants is 2.0 mmol/l to 7.0 mmol/l.

Note
:	One mmol/l of glucose equals 18 mg/dl.

### 8-4 What is hypoglycaemia?

A blood glucose concentration below 2.0 mmol/l (35 mg/dl) is abnormal and, therefore, defined as hypoglycaemia (hypo = low; glycaemia = blood glucose). Mild hypoglycaemia is defined as a blood glucose concentration between 1.5 to 2.0 mmol/l while severe hypoglycaemia is defined as a blood glucose concentration of less than 1.5 mmol/l (25 mg/dl). Whenever a reagent strip gives a reading below 1.5 mmol/l, a sample of blood should be taken, if possible, to confirm the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia by a laboratory measurement. The definition of hypoglycaemia when serum is sent to the laboratory is a concentration below 2.5 mmol/l (blood glucose is lower than serum glucose concentrations).

Note
:	The definition of hypoglycaemia in newborn infants remains debatable with textbooks often giving different cut-off points.

> Hypoglycaemia is defined as a blood glucose concentration below 2.0 mmol/l.

### 8-5 What are the dangers of hypoglycaemia?

Hypoglycaemia is extremely dangerous especially when the blood glucose concen­tration is below 1.5 mmol/l. When the blood glucose concentration is low the cells of the body, particularly the brain, do not receive enough glucose and cannot produce energy for their metabolism. As a result the brain cells can be damaged or die, causing cerebral palsy, mental retardation or death.

> Hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage or death.

### 8-6 When are infants at risk of developing hypoglycaemia? 

Infants are at an increased risk of developing hypoglycaemia when:

1. They have reduced energy stores.
2. They have increased energy needs.

### 8-7 Which infants have reduced energy stores?

The supply of glucose into the blood is reduced when the body’s energy stores are low, such as reduced glycogen in the liver, protein in muscles, and fat under the skin.

The following newborn infants do not have adequate energy stores to convert into glucose:

1. **Preterm infants.** They are born before adequate amounts of glycogen, protein and fat are stored in their tissues. The fetus gets most of its energy stores in the last 6 weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, most preterm infants have very small energy stores.
2. **Underweight for gestational age or wasted infants.** They have either not built up energy stores or have used up most of their energy stores before delivery because they have not been getting enough glucose from their mother.
3. **Starved infants.** Infants that are not fed, either orally or intravenously soon after delivery, rapidly use up their energy stores.
4. **Stressed infants,** such as infants who are *infected* or who have suffered *hypoxia*, may be unable to convert their energy stores into glucose. This includes infants who need active resuscitation at birth.
5. **Infants with liver damage,** such as hepatitis, often have low stores of liver glycogen and also are unable to convert other energy stores into glucose.

### 8-8 Which infants have increased energy needs?

The following infants have increased energy needs and, therefore, rapidly use up their energy stores:

1. **Infants with respiratory distress.** Their respiratory muscles are doing a lot of work and require large amounts of glucose to provide the energy needed for respiration.
2. **Hypothermic infants.** These infants use large amounts of glucose and fat to produce heat in an attempt to correct their body temperature.
3. **Infants of diabetic mothers.** Before delivery these infants receive excess glucose across the placenta, especially if the maternal diabetes is poorly controlled. The higher the maternal glucose concentration, the more glucose the infant receives. This large supply of glucose makes the fetus obese and stimulates the fetal pancreas to secrete extra insulin. At delivery the supply of glucose from the mother suddenly stops when the umbilical cord is clamped. However, the stimulated fetal pancreas continues to secrete excessive amounts of insulin after delivery, and the high insulin concentration in the blood of the newborn infant causes hypoglycaemia.
4. **Overweight for gestational age infants.** Some of the mothers of these infants may be undiagnosed diabetics. Think of maternal diabetes in all obese infants.
5. **Polycythaemic infants.** Their increased number of red cells use a lot of glucose.

> Hypothermia causes hypoglycaemia.

Note
:	With maternal diabetes, the mother is diabetic but the infant is not. In fact the problem in the infant is exactly the opposite to that in the mother. While the mother secretes too little insulin and, therefore, has a high blood glucose, the newborn infant secretes too much insulin and, therefore, becomes hypoglycaemic. Insulin acts as a fetal growth hormone. Excess fetal insulin, therefore, results in macrosomia.

## Hypoglycaemia

### 8-9 Which infants have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia?

Those infants with a decreased supply of glucose or an increased demand for glucose (i.e. infants with small energy stores or large energy needs):

1. Low birth weight infants (either preterm or underweight for gestational age)
2. Wasted infants
3. Infants where there is a delay in the onset of feeding (infants who have not been fed)
4. Hypoxic infants and infants who need active resuscitation at birth
5. Infected infants
6. Infants with liver disease
7. Infants with respiratory distress
8. Hypothermic infants
9. Infants of diabetic mothers
10. Overweight for gestational age infants
11. Polycythaemic infants

> Low birth weight infants and starved infants are at high risk for hypoglycaemia.

### 8-10 What are the clinical signs of hypoglycaemia?

Hypoglycaemia may produce *no clinical signs* or present with non-specific signs only. This makes the clinical diagnosis of hypoglycaemia very difficult. When present, the signs of hypoglycaemia are:

1. **Depression of brain function.** The infant may be lethargic and hypotonic, feed poorly, have a weak cry, apnoea, cyanosis or an absent Moro reflex.
2. **Overstimulation of brain function.** The infant may be jittery with a high-pitched cry, a fixed stare and fisting, have abnormal eye movements or convulsions.
3. **Excessive sweating.** This sign may not be present, however, especially in preterm infants.

Often an infant has some signs of brain stimulation (such as jitteriness )and other signs of brain depression (such as poor feeding) at the same time. Therefore, while some parts of the brain may be stimulated other parts may be depressed by hypoglycaemia. As a result, the clinical presentation of hypoglycaemia is very variable, making the clinical diagnosis of hypoglycaemia very unreliable.

> Hypoglycaemic infants may have no abnormal clinical signs.

### 8-11 How can you diagnose hypoglycaemia?

The clinical diagnosis is difficult and often missed. Therefore, it is essential that all infants at risk of hypoglycaemia, and infants with clinical signs that may be caused by hypoglycaemia, be screened with reagent strips. Whenever possible, use a reflectance meter such as an Accu-chek or Glucotrend meter rather than reading the reagent strip by eye. Ideally a diagnosis of hypoglycaemia made with reagent strips should be confirmed with a laboratory serum glucose measurement.

An infant’s blood glucose concentration will fall into one of the following groups:

1. 2.0 mmol/l *or more*. Remember that the normal range of blood glucose in newborn infants is 2.0 mmol/l to 7.0 mmol/l.
2. *Between* 1.5 mmol/l and 2.0 mmol/l. This is mild hypoglycaemia. These infants’ blood glucose concentration is abnormally low and they are at high risk of developing severe hypoglycaemia.
3. *Less than* 1.5 mmol/l. This is the definition of severe hypoglycaemia, which is very dangerous.

### 8-12 How can you prevent hypoglycaemia?

The following steps must be taken to prevent hypoglycaemia:

1. Identify all infants at high risk of developing hypoglycaemia.
2. Monitor the blood glucose concentration of these infants with reagent strips so that a falling blood glucose can be detected before hypoglycaemic levels are reached.
3. Feed all infants as soon as possible after delivery, especially preterm, underweight for gestational age and wasted infants, as well as infants of diabetic women.
4. Whenever possible, milk feeds should be given. Both clear feeds orally and oral dextrose feeds should *not* be used in newborn infants as they are low in energy and may result in hypoglycaemia.
5. If milk feeds cannot be given, then an intravenous infusion of 10% glucose (e.g. Neonatalyte) should be started.
6. Prevent hypothermia.

> Early feeding with milk helps to prevent hypoglycaemia.

### 8-13 How should you treat an infant with mild hypoglycaemia?

These infants, with a blood glucose concen­tration between 1.5 mmol/l and 2.0 mmol/l, need milk feeds or intravenous glucose urgently to prevent severe hypoglycaemia:

1. If they tolerate oral or nasogastric feeds, give 10 ml/kg breast milk or milk formula immediately. Do not give 5% or 10% dextrose orally as the energy content is less than that of breast milk or milk formula.
2. Repeat the blood glucose measurement 30 minutes after the feed to determine whether the blood glucose concentration has returned to the normal range. If it is still in the mild hypoglycaemia range, repeat the feed with an added 5 ml sugar (one teaspoon) per 30 ml milk and repeat the blood glucose measurement after a further 30 minutes.
3. When the blood glucose concentration has returned to normal, continue with regular milk feeds and continue to monitor with reagent strips hourly for 3 hours. If the blood glucose concentration remains low despite 2 milk feeds, start an intravenous infusion.
4. If the blood glucose concentration falls below 1.5 mmol/l at any time, treat for severe hypoglycaemia.
5. If the infant is too small or too ill to tolerate milk feeds, start a 10% intravenous infusion (e.g. Neonatalyte). Monitor the blood glucose concentration with reagent strips and start milk feeds as soon as possible.

Remember that mild hypoglycaemia may rapidly progress to severe hypoglycaemia if not correctly treated.

> Mild hypoglycaemia can usually be corrected with milk feeds.

### 8-14 How should you treat an infant with severe hypoglycaemia?

All infants with a blood glucose concentration below 1.5 mmol/l have severe hypoglycaemia. This is a medical emergency and must be treated immediately. Do not wait for the result of the laboratory measurement before starting treatment. The management of severe hypoglycaemia consists of the following steps:

1. The treatment of choice is to start an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose (or Neonatalyte) at a drip rate calculated to give 60 ml/kg in the first 24 hours. Infants older than 24 hours can be given a larger volume calculated for their age.

	Note
	:	A 10% dextrose infusion at 60 ml/kg/24 hours will provide 0.22 mmol (4 mg) glucose/kg/minute which will meet most infants’ energy needs. To increase a 5% to a 10% glucose solution, add 10 ml of 50% dextrose to 100 ml 5% dextrose. Some infants will need a 15% glucose solution, however, to maintain a normal blood glucose concentration. 

2. If you cannot rapidly establish a peripheral intravenous line, insert an umbilical vein catheter so that intravenous fluids can be given.
3. Once an intravenous line has been estab­lished, give 2 ml/kg of 10% glucose as a bolus. It is not advisable to inject a bolus of 25% or 50% dextrose as it is extremely hypertonic.
4. If the blood glucose concentration still has not returned to normal within a further 15 minutes, give 5 mg hydrocortisone intravenously.

	Note
	:	Take 5 ml of blood from these infants for glucose and insulin estimation before giving the hydrocortisone. This is very important in identifying the correct cause of the hypoglycaemia. Glucagon 0.3 mg/kg IM or IV can be used if hydrocortisone fails to correct the blood glucose concentration.

5. In an emergency, if you are unable to give intravenous dextrose, give the infant 10 ml/kg breast milk or formula (or cow’s milk if neither is available) by mouth or via a nasogastric tube. You can add 5 ml (a teaspoon) of sugar, or 5 ml of 50% dextrose, per 10 ml feed to increase the energy concentration. Do not give pure 50% dextrose as it will cause vomiting.
6. Start regular milk feeds as soon as possible. Extra sugar can be added to the milk feeds if necessary.
7. As the volume of milk feeds are increased the rate of the intravenous infusion can be reduced. Never suddenly withdraw intravenous dextrose as this may precipitate hypoglycaemia, as commonly happens if the drip infiltrates the tissues. Reduce the drip rate gradually when oral feeds are introduced.
8. Keep the infant warm.
9. Once the blood glucose concentration has returned to normal, monitor the blood glucose concentration hourly until full volume feeds have been established.

Note
:	Repeated or unresponsive hypoglycaemia may be due to a rare metabolic cause and urgent specialist medical advice must be sought. A sample of venous blood should be taken for further investigations.

> The treatment of severe hypoglycaemia is an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose.

### 8-15 How frequently should you measure the blood glucose concentration?

The blood glucose concentration should be closely monitored in infants at risk of hypoglycaemia and in infants who have had hypoglycaemia:

1. In most infants at high risk of hypogly­caemia, the blood glucose concentration should be measured hourly with for the first 3 hours, then 2 hourly for the next 3 hours. Thereafter the blood glucose should be monitored every 3 hours until 100 ml/kg/day milk feeds have been established which is usually in 24 to 48 hours.
2. Infants with mild hypoglycaemia should be monitored every 30 minutes until the blood glucose concentration has returned to the normal range. Readings should then be made hourly for 3 hours to ensure that the blood glucose concentration does not fall again. Thereafter, measure the blood glucose concentration every 2 hours until 100 ml/kg milk feeds are established.
3. Infants with severe hypoglycaemia should have their blood glucose concentration measured every 15 minutes until it has increased above 1.5 mmol/l. Then measure the blood glucose concentration as for infants with mild hypoglycaemia.

The greater the risk of hypoglycaemia the more frequently the blood glucose concentration should be monitored.

### 8-16 What is the prognosis after hypoglycaemia?

The risk of brain damage depends on the severity, duration and number of hypoglycaemic attacks. The prognosis is worst if the hypoglycaemia has produced clinical signs, especially convulsions. The risk of permanent brain damage is probably low if the hypoglycaemia is asymptomatic. However, asymptomatic hypoglycaemia remains dangerous and must be treated urgently as clinical signs may suddenly develop.

## Hyperglycaemia

### 8-17 What is hyperglycaemia?

Hyperglycaemia (hyper = high; glycaemia = blood glucose) is defined as a blood glucose concentration above 7.0 mmol/l (120 mg/dl). Usually hyperglycaemia does not cause problems until the blood glucose concentration increases above 10 mmol/l.

### 8-18 What is the cause of hyperglycaemia?

1. Hyperglycaemia is usually due to a 10% dextrose or Neonatalyte infusion given to a preterm infant during the first few days of life. Some immature infants are not able to remove glucose fast enough from the blood stream.
2. Hyperglycaemia may be caused by a severe intraventricular haemorrhage.
3. The stress of hypoxia or infection may increase or decrease the blood glucose concentration.

Note
:	Transient or permanent neonatal diabetes is a rare cause of hyperglycaemia.

### 8-19 What are the dangers of hyper­glycaemia?

1. A high blood glucose concentration results in a lot of glucose being excreted in the urine (glycosuria), which in turn may cause polyuria and lead to dehydration. Mild glycosuria is common in preterm infants and does not require treatment.
2. Severe hyperglycaemia increases the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants.

### 8-20 How should you treat hyperglycaemia?

The raised blood glucose concentration usually can be lowered into the normal range by simply changing the intravenous solution from Neonatalyte or 10% dextrose to a 5% dextrose solution. Once milk feeds are established, hyperglycaemia usually returns to normal.

## Case study 1

A term infant is brought to a rural clinic after having been born at home. The infant is cold and wasted but otherwise appears well. A reagent strip reading is between 1.5 and 2.0 mmol/l when the colour is matched against the container.

### 1. What is your interpretation of the blood glucose concentration?

The infant has mild hypoglycaemia. This should be confirmed with a reflectance meter if possible as reading a reagent strip by eye is not very accurate.

### 2. What is the danger of mild hypo­glycaemia?

The infant is at high risk of developing severe hypoglycaemia.

### 3. Why does this term infant have a low blood glucose concentration?

Because the infant is cold. Hypothermic infants increase the rate at which they break down glucose in order to produce heat. Eventually the energy stores become depleted and hypoglycaemia may result. In addition this infant is wasted and, therefore, has reduced energy stores.

### 4. Why is this infant at risk of brain damage?

Because the infant has mild hypoglycaemia. This may progress to severe hypoglycaemia if not correctly managed. Remember that even without clinical signs, hypoglycaemia is still dangerous.

### 5. How would you treat this infant at the clinic?

Give the infant a feed of breast milk, formula milk or sweetened cow’s milk. The infant must also be warmed. The blood glucose concentration should have returned to normal in 30 minutes. If not, repeat the feed and arrange urgent transport to the nearest hospital. If the infant develops severe hypoglycaemia, or is to be transported, an infusion with Neonatalyte or 10% dextrose must be started. It is very important to start treatment before referring the infant to hospital. The blood glucose concentration must be carefully monitored during transport.

## Case study 2

A preterm infant of 1500 g is born in a level I hospital. The infant is nursed in a closed incubator but no feed is given for 2 hours. At 1 hour after birth the Haemo-Glukotest reading with a Reflolux meter is normal but at 2 hours after birth the reading indicates severe hypoglycaemia. The infant is jittery with a poor Moro reflex.

### 1. Why is this infant hypoglycaemic?

The infant is preterm and, therefore, has little energy store. In addition the infant has not been fed for 2 hours after birth. The normal blood glucose concentration at 1 hour indicates that the infant had energy stores to last 1 but not 2 hours.

### 2. How could the hypoglycaemia have been prevented?

Breast or formula feeds via a nasogastric tube or an intravenous infusion should have been started within an hour of delivery.

### 3. Could the hypoglycaemia have caused the jitteriness and poor Moro reflex?

Yes. The brain uses glucose to obtain energy. Therefore, hypoglycaemia interferes with the normal functioning of the brain and may cause both depression of brain function resulting in a poor Moro reflex and overstimulation of the brain resulting in jitteriness.

### 4. How would you treat this infant?

An intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose or Neonatalyte must be started immediately at a rate to give 60 ml/kg/day. Add 2 ml/kg of 10% dextrose as a bolus. Repeat the reagent strip measurement after 15 minutes. If it is still low give a dose of 5 mg hydrocortisone intravenously. Start milk feeds every 2 hours as soon as possible. If the milk feeds are tolerated and the blood glucose concentration returns to normal, then the rate of the 10% dextrose infusion can be slowly reduced. Monitor the blood glucose concentration carefully.

### 5. Why could this infant not be treated with 5% dextrose orally?

Because 5% dextrose does not contain enough glucose to rapidly correct hypoglycaemia.

### 6. Has this infant already suffered brain damage?

It is possible as the infant has symptomatic hypoglycaemia. With immediate treatment there is a good chance that this infant will not suffer permanent brain damage.

## Case study 3

An infant weighing 4500 g is born to a patient whose diabetes was poorly controlled during pregnancy. The infant is sweating a lot and has a convulsion. The blood glucose concentration is 0 mmol/l. Attempts to give 10% dextrose water via a scalp vein needle fail as the staff cannot find a suitable vein.

### 1. Why is this infant hypoglycaemic?

Because the mother is a poorly controlled diabetic. Excessive glucose crosses the placenta to the fetus and this stimulates the fetal pancreas to secrete excessive insulin. Soon after birth the infant becomes hypoglycaemic as a result of the large amount of insulin still being secreted by the infant’s pancreas.

### 2. Can hypoglycaemia cause sweating and convulsions?

Yes, in both infants and adults hypoglycaemia may present with sweating and convulsions. The convulsions are worrying as they suggest that the function of the brain has been severely affected.

### 3. What should the staff do if they cannot find a suitable vein?

Give 10% dextrose or Neonatalyte via an umbilical vein catheter.

### 4. What should be done if the hypoglycaemia cannot be corrected with an infusion of 10% dextrose?

Give 5 mg hydrocortisone intravenously.

### 5. How could the hypoglycaemia have been prevented?

The maternal diabetes should have been well controlled. As this infant is at very high risk of hypoglycaemia due to the poor diabetic control and high birth weight, milk feeds should have been given straight away and a 10% dextrose or Neonatalyte infusion started. Once feeds are tolerated and the reagent strip readings are normal, the infusion can gradually be slowed.

# Skills workshop: Glucose control and hypoglycaemia

## Objectives

When you have completed this skills workshop you should be able to:

* Measure the glucose concentration of capillary blood with reagent strips.
* Measure the glucose concentration of capillary blood with a glucose meter.
* Insert an umbilical vein catheter.

## Measuring the glucose concentration in capillary blood with reagent strips

### 8-a The equipment that is needed

1. An alcohol swab or gauze swab soaked with surgical spirits
2. A sterile lancet
3. A container for ‘sharps’, i.e. for lancets
4. Reagent strips such as Haemo-Glukotest
5. Cotton wool swab to stop the bleeding
6. A clock or watch
7. Plastic squeeze bottle of water
8. Paper towel and cotton wool

### 8-b Description of reagent strips

An infant’s blood glucose concentration can be simply, cheaply and rapidly measured using a reagent strip. This consists of a plastic strip to which is attached a block of paper (the reagent area) containing the required chemical reagents. A commonly used reagent strip for newborn infants is Haemo-Glukotest. Reagent strips are packed, together with a desiccant, in a plastic container. The desiccant keeps the reagent strips dry while the container prevents damage to the reagent strips by bright light. The reagent strips should be stored at room temperature, not in a fridge. Keep away from direct sunlight. The cap must be replaced immediately after a reagent strip is removed. Once the bottle or container is opened, the reagent strips must not be used beyond the expiry date. Always replace the stopper of the container as soon as a strip is removed. 

Note
:	The reagent strip contains the enzymes glucose oxidase and peroxidase, together with a colour indicator. The glucose oxidase reacts specifically with glucose, releasing hydrogen peroxide. This in turn is broken down by the peroxidase, to oxidise the colour agent. The higher the concentration of glucose in the blood the greater is the colour change. The reagent strips, therefore, are specific for glucose.

### 8-c How to obtain a capillary blood sample

While capillary blood is usually used, a sample of venous or arterial blood is also suitable. 

![Figure 8-A: The areas of the heel (shaded) that are usually used to obtain capillary blood][fig-8-A]

*Figure 8-A: The areas of the heel (shaded) that are usually used to obtain capillary blood.*

Capillary blood is usually obtained from the infant’s heel:

1. Clean the skin over the side of the heel with an alcohol swab.
2. Allow the skin to dry and then pierce the skin with a lancet to obtain 1 large drop of blood. Usually the skin is pierced in the areas shown in Figure 8-A. Recent research has shown that piercing the skin over the middle and back of the heel with a lancet is safe and very unlikely to penetrate the periosteum of the bone and cause osteitis.
3. Put the lancet into a container for ‘sharps’.
4. Transfer the drop of blood onto the reagent strip and stop the bleeding by compressing the puncture site for a few minutes.

### 8-d Do not prick your finger by mistake

Be very careful not to prick your finger by mistake when obtaining a sample of capillary blood from an infant. Immediately after piercing the infant’s skin, the lancet must be placed in a special container for ‘sharps’. It is very important to dispose of the lancet before transferring the drop of blood onto the reagent strip. Most people prick themselves while removing the used equipment after the procedure. Therefore, never leave a lancet or needle lying exposed. Viruses such as hepatitis B and HIV can be transmitted as a result of a finger prick with a lancet or needle if the patient is infected.

> Place the lancet in a special container for ‘sharps’ immediately after piercing the skin.

### 8-e The types of reagent strips available

Most strips show a colour change which can be read by eye. They can also be read with a special device (a reflectance meter) which gives a more objective reading. Common examples of reagent strips are Haemo-Glukotest and Accu-Check Active.

### 8-f How to use a haemo-glukotest reagent strip

1. Place a large drop of blood onto the two reagent areas, which are found on the printed side of the plastic strip. Both reagent areas must be covered with blood.
2. Wait exactly 60 seconds then quickly wipe the blood off the reagent area with a piece of cotton wool. Do not touch the reagent area with your finger.
3. After a further 60 seconds compare the colour of the reagent areas by holding the strip against the colour chart on the container. A good light is essential.
4. The reagent area, closer to the end of the reagent strip that you hold, gives the more accurate measurement if the blood glucose concentration is in the normal or low range. The colour chart consists of 7 colour blocks ranging from yellow through grey-green to dark blue, which indicate blood glucose concentrations from 1 mmol/l (20 mg/dl) to 17 mmol/l (300 mg/dl) and above. The reagent area may match a colour block or fall between 2 adjacent colour blocks.

It is essential that the method described is strictly adhered to. Otherwise an incorrect reading may be obtained. For a more accurate measurement of the blood glucose concentration, a blood glucose meter (Reflolux) can be used to read the Haemo-Glukotest strips.

### 8-g Common errors with reagent strips

1. The reagent strips must be fresh. Age, temperature, humidity or light may cause the reagents to deteriorate. This may result in a falsely low reading. The reagent strips must also be discarded if the expiry date on the bottle has been reached.
2. The whole reagent area must be covered with blood to prevent difficulty reading the colour change. A large drop of blood is, therefore, needed.
3. The blood must be wiped off after exactly 60 seconds. Waiting less than 60 seconds will give a falsely low reading while waiting too long will give a falsely high reading. It is advisable to use a watch or clock with a second hand to measure the 60 seconds accurately.
4. Do not attempt to wipe or wash off or rub off any pieces of adherent, dry blood as excessive washing will give a falsely low reading.
5. A low packed cell volume (PCV) may give a falsely high reading while a high PCV may give a false low reading.
6. If possible, all readings below 2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl) should be confirmed with a blood glucose meter or by a laboratory measurement of the blood glucose concentration in venous or arterial blood.

## Measuring the glucose concentration in capillary blood with a glucose meter

### 8-h How to use a Reflolux blood glucose meter

A blood glucose meter (such as Reflolux) allows the reagent strip to be read more accurately than is possible with the eye. This is particularly important when the blood glucose concentration is below 2 mmol/l.

1. Press the ‘On/Off’ button of the Reflolux meter to switch the instrument on.
2. Obtain a drop of blood as described above.
3. Transfer the drop of blood onto the Haemo-Glukotest strip making sure that both blocks of paper are covered.
4. Immediately press the ‘Time’ button on the Reflolux meter.
5. After 60 seconds wipe the blood off the Haemo-Glukotest strip with a piece of cotton wool.
6. Insert the Haemo-Glukotest strip into the opening of the Reflolux meter with the blocks of paper facing the ‘On/Off’ button.
7. After 120 seconds the blood glucose concen­tration is displayed on the Reflolux meter.
8. Remove the Haemo-Glukotest strip after noting the reading.
9. Press the ‘On/Off’ button to switch the instrument off.

When a new container of Haemo-Glukotest strips is opened the Reflolux meter must be calibrated with the bar code enclosed in the container. Insert the code strip into the Reflolux meter and switch the instrument on. The code will be read and displayed on the panel. This will calibrate the meter.

Accu-Chek Active test strips can also be read by eye but are best used with an Accu-Chek Active, Accu-Chek Plus or Glucotrend monitor. The method of using the strips and the monitor are given in the package insert.

## Inserting an umbilical vein catheter

### 8-i Common indications for inserting an umbilical vein catheter

An umbilical vein catheter should be considered in any infant of less than 48 hours of age when an urgent intravenous line is needed and a peripheral vein infusion cannot be started. Usually a sterile, end-hole umbilical vein or artery catheter is used to catheterise the umbilical vein. If this is not available, a sterile nasogastric tube may be used.

The common indications for an umbilical vein catheter are:

1. Need for urgent correction of hypoglycaemia.
2. Need for urgent intravenous fluids at resuscitation.
3. Need for plasma volume expanders in a shocked infant.
4. Inability to start a peripheral infusion in a small or sick infant.
5. Exchange transfusion.

### 8-j The equipment needed

1. A sterile size F5 umbilical vein or artery catheter (or nasogastric tube).
2. A 5 ml syringe.
3. An ampoule of normal saline.
4. A sterile scalpel blade.
5. Surgical spirits.
6. Sterile swabs.
7. A sterile linen cord tie.
8. Narrow adhesive strapping.
9. An aerosol can of acrylic spray (plastic skin).
10. A container for ‘sharps’.

These items should be packed and ready in a surgical tray. Remember that inserting an umbilical vein catheter is a sterile procedure.

### 8-k How to insert an umbilical vein catheter

1. Put on a face mask.
2. Wash your hands and forearms well. Dry with a sterile paper towel and put on sterile gloves.
3. Open the sterile pack and fill the sterile syringe with normal saline. Attach the catheter to the syringe and fill the catheter with saline to displace any air.
4. The infant should be placed naked on its back in a warm environment. A good light is essential.
5. While the assistant lifts up the umbilical cord stump with an artery forcep, clean the cord and peri-umbilical skin well with surgical spirits.
6. Place a sterile towel around the umbilicus.
7. Loosely tie a sterile tape around the base of the umbilical cord. This is done so that the tape can be quickly tied if the cut umbilical vessels start to bleed.

	![Figure 8-B: Loosely tie a tape around the base of the umbilical cord][fig-8-B]

	*Figure 8-B: Loosely tie a tape around the base of the umbilical cord.*
	
8. Grasp the base of the cord between the thumb and index finger of one hand. Do not release the pressure on the base of the cord until the catheter has been inserted and the tape around the base of the cord has been firmly tied. This is very important to prevent bleeding from the cord vessels.

	![Figure 8-C: Squeeze the base of the umbilical cord to prevent any possible bleeding from the umbilical vessels when they are cut][fig-8-C]

	*Figure 8-C: Squeeze the base of the umbilical cord to prevent any possible bleeding from the umbilical vessels when they are cut.*
	
9. While squeezing the base of the cord, ask the assistant to hold up the cord away from the infant’s abdominal wall. Now cut the cord off about 2 cm from the skin. Immediately after cutting the umbilical cord, the scalpel blade must be dropped into a special container for ‘sharps’.
10. On the cut end of the cord you will now see the one umbilical vein and two umbilical arteries. The umbilical vein is thin walled and situated towards the infant’s head (at 12 o’clock) while the umbilical arteries have thick walls and are situated towards the infant’s feet (at 4 and 8 o’clock).

	![Figure 8-D: The cut surface of the umbilical cord has one thin-walled vein and two thick walled arteries][fig-8-D]

	*Figure 8-D: The cut surface of the umbilical cord has one thin-walled vein and two thick walled arteries.*

11. Insert the tip of the saline-filled catheter into the umbilical vein. Only gentle pressure is needed to introduce the catheter. Feed about 10 cm of the catheter into the vein, when you should be able to aspirate blood.
12. Tighten the knot of the tape around the umbilical cord to prevent bleeding from the arteries. Only now should you release your grip on the base of the umbilical cord.

	![Figure 8-E: The catheter has been inserted into the umbilical vein and the tape has been tied tightly around the base of the umbilical cord][fig-8-E]

	*Figure 8-E: The catheter has been inserted into the umbilical vein and the tape has been tied tightly around the base of the umbilical cord.*

13. Spray the area of skin around the umbilicus with acrylic spray (plastic skin) and allow to dry.
14. Cut 2 lengths of strapping about 15 cm each. Fold them as shown in Figure 8.F and attach to the prepared skin on either side of the umbilical cord to form the ‘uprights’ of a ‘soccer goal post’.

	![Figure 8-F: Two lengths of strapping are folded as illustrated][fig-8-F]

	*Figure 8-F: Two lengths of strapping are folded as illustrated.*
	
	![Figure 8-G: The pieces of strapping are stuck to the prepared skin on either side of the umbilical cord][fig-8-G]

	*Figure 8-G: The pieces of strapping are stuck to the prepared skin on either side of the umbilical cord.*
	
15. Use a piece of strapping to fix the catheter to the ‘uprights’ as shown.

	![Figure 8-H: A piece of strapping is used to fix the catheter in place][fig-8-H]

	*Figure 8-H: A piece of strapping is used to fix the catheter in place.*
	
16. The catheter is now ready to be used and can be attached to a syringe, intravenous giving set or to a 3 way tap.

The method of inserting a catheter into the umbilical vein can be practised on the umbilical cord still attached to a placenta after delivery.

### 8-l Problems with umbilical vein catheters

1. Bleeding is the most serious complication. Bleeding can occur if the base of the cord is not tightly held during the procedure. Bleeding can also occur after the catheter is inserted if the tie is not tightly in place or if the catheter is dislodged from the vein.
2. If the procedure is not conducted in a sterile manner, infection can be introduced.
3. Air may be introduced via the vein if the syringe and catheter are not first filled with saline.
4. It may not be possible to insert the catheter if the cord is cut too long, if an attempt is made in error to catheterise one of the arteries or if the infant is more than a few days old and the vein has dried out.
5. Dextrose 50% and sodium bicarbonate 8% should never be given via the umbilical vein as they are very hypertonic and may cause liver damage.
6. Rarely portal vein thrombosis may complicate umbilical vein catheterisation.
7. The catheter may be inserted into an umbilical artery by mistake.

Do not insert an umbilical vein catheter if it is possible to put up a peripheral vein infusion (drip) as this is less dangerous.
