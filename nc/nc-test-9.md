What is the definition of jaundice?
	- An increase in the concentration of bilirubin in the serum.
	- The yellow discolouration of the skin and sclera due to deposits of bilirubin. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- A general feeling of nausea and lethargy.
	- Yellow skin due to eating carrots.
Bilirubin is formed by the breakdown of:
	- Haemoglobin `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Bile
	- Stercobilin
	- Proteins
What is the normal total serum bilirubin concentration (TSB) in cord blood?
	- 0 µmol/l
	- Less than 35 µmol/l `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- 35–55 µmol/l
	- More than 55 µmol/l
Before bilirubin can be excreted by the newborn infant it must first be: 
	- Oxidised in the kidney
	- Haemolysed in the blood stream
	- Conjugated in the liver `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Digested in the gut
Jaundice lasting more than 3 weeks after delivery may be caused by:
	- Hypothyroidism `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Hyperthyroidism
	- Hypoglycaemia
	- Anaemia
Jaundice is commonest in:
	- Preterm infants `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Term infants
	- Postterm infants
	- Underweight for gestational age infants
Hepatitis commonly presents with obstructive jaundice and:
	- Dark stools
	- Pale stools `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Blood-stained stools
	- Blood in the urine
Jaundice between day 2 and 7 is:
	- Always abnormal
	- Usually a sign of haemolytic disease
	- Always treated with phototherapy
	- Common in normal, healthy infants `correct`{:.correct-answer}
Haemolytic disease of the newborn is caused by:
	- Lack of vitamin K
	- Bacteria crossing the placenta from the mother to the fetus
	- A cephalhaematoma or bruising
	- Damage to fetal red blood cells caused by maternal antibodies `correct`{:.correct-answer}
ABO haemolytic disease is likely in the following combination of blood groups:
	- The mother is A and the infant is B.
	- The mother is A and the infant is O.
	- The mother is O and the infant is A. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- The mother is O and the infant is O.
A positive Coomb’s test in the cord blood is found in:
	- Hepatitis
	- Physiological jaundice
	- ABO incompatibility `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Jaundice of immaturity
Hydrops (generalised oedema of the newborn) is common in:
	- ABO haemolytic disease
	- Rhesus haemolytic disease `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Biliary atresia
	- Jaundice of immaturity
Anti-D immunoglobulin should be given after delivery, miscarriage or antepartum haemorrhage to:
	- All women
	- All women who have had a previous infant with Rhesus haemolytic disease
	- All Rhesus-positive women
	- All Rhesus-negative women `correct`{:.correct-answer}
In Rhesus haemolytic disease the mothers blood group may be:
	- O –ve `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- O +ve
	- A +ve
	- B +ve
Rhesus haemolytic disease must be suspected if:
	- An infant is jaundiced in the first 24 hours of life. `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- An infant has an elevated haemoglobin.
	- The Coomb’s test on the cord blood is negative.
	- The infant is a male.
Bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus) causes:
	- Liver failure
	- Green staining of the skin called bronzing
	- Mental retardation `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- No clinical problems
Phototherapy acts by:
	- Making unconjugated bilirubin water soluble `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Conjugating bilirubin
	- Stimulating the liver
	- Changing bilirubin to stercobilin
During phototherapy the serum bilirubin concentration is lowered by exposing the infant to:
	- Ultraviolet light
	- Visible light `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Infrared light
	- Heat
What treatment should be given to an infant if the total serum bilirubin concentration is above 400 µmol/l?
	- Phototherapy alone
	- Exchange transfusion `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- Oral phenobarbitone
	- Frequent feeds
What is the normal range of packed cell volume (PCV) at birth?
	- 10–25%
	- 25–45%
	- 45–65% `correct`{:.correct-answer}
	- 65–75%
