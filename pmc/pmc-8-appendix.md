## Guidelines for the management of patients with risk factors and medical problems during pregnancy, labour and the puerperium

The following tables list most of the risk factors and medical problems which may occur during pregnancy, labour and the puerperium. They also give the possible adverse effects of these conditions, indicate the actions needed, and suggest the level of care required. The tables should be read but need not be learned. These tables provide a very useful reference for both midwives and doctors who are caring for a patients with risk factors.

The following list gives risk factors which may occur during pregnancy together with their possible adverse effects and assorted problems, and actions which can lead to the prevention, early diagnosis and correct management of complications. The level of care required by the patient is noted in the last column. The list also serves as a useful guide to management, and can be referred to when risk factors are present or develop during pregnancy. The management of many of the problems is discussed in more detail elsewhere in the Perinatal Education Programme.

The level of care needed is shown as follows:

1 = For low-risk patients
2 = For intermediate-risk patients
3 = For high-risk patients

| **Risk factors** | **Possible adverse effects during pregnancy and associated problems** | **Action** | **Level of care** |
+===========================================================================================================================+
| **Risk factors identified from the patient’s history** |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Maternal age |
+--------------+                                                      
| 15 years or less | Pregnancy may have a detrimental effect on the development of the patient’s personality. | Determine the duration of pregnancy. If 20 weeks or less termination may be indicated. | 2 |
+-----------------------------------------------+ 
| 16-19 years | Poor social circumstances. 
Pre-eclampsia.
Anaemia. | Refer to social worker for support. 
Watch for proteinuria and a rise in blood pressure from 28 weeks. 
Regular Hb checks. | 1 |
+------------------+---+
| 37 years or more | Medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are commoner. | Carefully look for medical problems at the first visit, and at 28 and 34 weeks.
Motivate for sterilisation. | 2 |
+------------------+            |               |
| 37 years or more | Chromosome abnormalities are commoner, e.g. Down syndrome | Determine the duration of pregnancy:
If 13 weeks or less, an ultrasound examination for nuchal thickness is done, followed at 22 weeks looking for structural defects.
If more than 13 weeks, a genetic amniocentesis should be done between 16 and 22 weeks.
Before referral, make sure that the patient will agree to termination of pregnancy, if this is indicated. | 2 |
+---------------------+

+---------------------+                                                  
| Allergies | Penicillin allergy with an anaphylactic reaction is always dangerous, but rarely occurs. | Allergies must always be clearly documented on the folder and antenatal card. | 1 |
+----------------------+
| Body Mass Index (BMI) | Cephalopelvic disproportion and shoulder dystocia.

Hypertension and diabetes

Use weight, height and attached BMI table.
When reading BMI off table:
With 1st visit in 2nd trimester, subtract 4 &nbsp;kg
With 1st visit in 3rd trimester, subtract 8 &nbsp;kg | Ultrasound examination for accurate gestational age estimation at 18-22 weeks.

Monitor for hypertension and glycosuria.


BMI below 40 | 1 |
BMI above 40 but below 50 | 2 |
BMI above 50 | 3 |
+------------------+
| Diabetes mellitus (in the patient) |  Pregnancy worsens the diabetes.
Insulin requirements increase.

+------------------------------------+
| Diabetes mellitus (family history) | There is an increased risk of the patient developing diabetes during pregnancy. | Careful screen for glycosuria:
If absent | 1 |
If present | 2 |
+----------------
| Epilepsy | Convulsions may occur more frequently in pregnancy. Some anticonvulsant drugs may cause congenital abnormalities. | The dose of anticonvulsant drugs may need to be increased. Put the patient on a safe drug before pregnancy (e.g. carbamazepine). The drugs are not changed during pregnancy because of the danger of convulsions. | 2 |
+------------------------------------------+
| Congenital abnormalities (in the family) | Serious abnormalities tend to recur. | Arrange for ultrasound and amniocentesis at 16 weeks: 
If normal | 1 |
If abnormal | 2 |
+---------------------+
| Drugs or medication | Danger of teratogenesis. 
Points towards a disease NOT mentioned in the history. | Get accurate details and consult a doctor. | 1 |
+-----+
| HIV | Mother-to-child transmission of HIV. | Join a prevention of mother-to-child transmission programme. |1|
With AIDS the mother’s clinical condition may deteriorate. | Refer to an antiretroviral (ARV) clinic. 
The stage of disease needs to be determined and noted. Check at each visit for symptoms and signs indicating progression to a more advanced stage of disease. | 2 |
+----------------------+
| Auto-immune diseases | Raised perinatal mortality rate.
Early onset of severe pre-eclampsia. | Get detailed information about the disease and medication. | 3 |
+---------------------+
| Psychiatric illness | Suicide is commoner.
Illness may become worse during pregnancy. | Get detailed information about the disease and medication.
Termination of pregnancy may be indicated (if duration of pregnancy is less than 20 weeks). | 2 |
+---------+
| Rubella | Congenital abnormalities. | Ask about fever and a skin rash in the first trimester of pregnancy and also about contact with rubella.
Antibody titres can confirm or exclude diagnosis. | 1 |
+----------------------------------+
| Thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism) | Thyrotoxicosis and/or goitre in the neonate. | Get detailed information about the illness and medication. Thyroid hormone levels in cord blood. | 2 |
+------------------------+
| **Systematic history** |
+------------------------+
| **Respiratory System** |
+------------------------+
| Asthma | Prostaglandin F2 alpha is contra-indicated. 
Asthma usually improves during pregnancy. | Ask about medication and symptoms:
Asymptomatic and not on steroids: | 1 |
Symptomatic and on steroids: | 2 |
+----------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Chronic cough more than 21 days. 
Night sweats and weight loss. | Possible tuberculosis and/or AIDS. | Single X-ray chest with fetus screened off and sputum for TB bacilli.

+-------------------------+
| Dyspnoea and orthopnoea | Symptoms of heart failure. | Underlying heart disease must be excluded or confirmed by the doctor. | 2 | 
+-------------------------+
| Rheumatic heart disease | Cardiac output increases with increased risk of cardiac failure and maternal death. | No symptoms or signs of heart failure, and no stenotic heart valve lesions: | 2 |
Symptoms and signs of heart failure and/or stenotic heart valve lesions: | 3 |
+----------------+
| Varicose veins | May indicate previous venous thrombosis.
Become worse during pregnancy. | 1 |
+------------------+
