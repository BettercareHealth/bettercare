	1.	Labour starting before 40 weeks of gestation.
	1.	Labour starting before 37 weeks of gestation.
	1.	Labour starting when the fetus is assessed as weighing less than 2000 g, when the gestational age is unknown.
2.	Preterm rupture of the membranes is defined as:
	1.	Membranes that have ruptured at term, and not been followed by the onset of labour within 24 hours.
	1.	Membranes that rupture before the second stage of labour.
	1.	Membranes that have ruptured before 37 weeks of gestation, in the absence of contractions.
	1.	Membranes that have ruptured before the onset of labour at any gestational age.
3.	Preterm labour is important because it commonly results in death of the infant due to:
	1.	Abruptio placentae.
	1.	Birth trauma.
	1.	Jaundice.
	1.	Hyaline membrane disease.
4.	Chorioamnionitis is usually caused by:
	1.	Bacteria which cross the placenta from the maternal circulation to the fetus.
	1.	Bacteria which spread from the cervix and vagina.
	1.	Viral infection of the genitalia.
	1.	Candida vaginitis.
5.	Choose the correct statement regarding chorioamnionitis:
	1.	It causes all cases of preterm labour.
	1.	It always follows preterm rupture of the membranes.
	1.	It may cause and complicate preterm rupture of the membranes.
	1.	It only occurs in patients with vaginitis.
6.	Subclinical chorioamnionitis usually results in:
	1.	No signs or symptoms in the mother or fetus.
	1.	Maternal pyrexia and tachycardia.
	1.	An offensive vaginal discharge.
	1.	Abdominal tenderness.
7.	Clinical chorioamnionitis may present with:
	1.	Headache and backache.
	1.	Vaginal bleeding.
	1.	Fetal tachycardia.
	1.	Dysuria and frequency.
8.	Antibiotics should be given to:
	1.	All patients with preterm rupture of the membranes.
	1.	All infants with preterm labour.
	1.	Patients with clinical signs of chorioamnionitis.
	1.	Patients with ruptured membranes, where the pregnancy is allowed to continue.
9.	Which of the following commonly causes preterm labour?
	1.	Multiple pregnancy.
	1.	Excessive weight gain during pregnancy.
	1.	A breech presentation.
	1.	No sexual intercourse in the second half of pregnancy.
10.	Which patients are at the highest risk of preterm labour?
	1.	Patients who book early in pregnancy.
	1.	Multigravidas.
	1.	Patients with a history of preterm labour in a previous pregnancy.
	1.	Patients living in low socio-economic circumstances.
11.	Women at increased risk of preterm labour should:
	1.	Increase their normal amount of exercise.
	1.	Not take baths.
	1.	Not be examined vaginally at the antenatal clinics.
	1.	Avoid coitus during the second half of their pregnancies.
12.	Braxton Hicks contractions:
	1.	Are sometimes uncomfortable but are not painful.
	1.	Are regular.
	1.	Are associated with cervical dilatation.
	1.	Increase in duration and frequency.
13.	Preterm labour is present when:
	1.	A patient experiences painful contractions prior to 37 weeks.
	1.	Regular uterine contractions, palpable on abdominal examination prior to 37 weeks is present.
	1.	Regular uterine contractions, palpable on abdominal examination and cervical effacement and/or dilatation on vaginal examination prior to 37 weeks.
	1.	A patient has a history of rupture of the membranes prior to 37 weeks irrespective of whether or not she has uterine contractions.
14.	Patients with preterm rupture of the membranes should have:
	1.	A digital vaginal examination to assess the state of the cervix.
	1.	A sterile speculum examination only.
	1.	No vaginal examination at all.
	1.	Only a rectal examination.
15.	The pH of amniotic fluid is:
	1.	Acid.
	1.	Neutral.
	1.	Alkaline.
	1.	Variable.
16.	How should a patient with preterm labour at a gestational age of 36 weeks be managed?
	1.	The patient should be delivered in a MOU or district hospital.
	1.	The patient should be delivered in a level 1 facility.
	1.	The patient should be referred to a level 2 facility for delivery.
	1.	Preterm labour should be suppressed and the patient transferred to a level 1 facility for further suppression of preterm labour.
17.	What should be done if preterm labour has been diagnosed at a primary care antenatal clinic and the patient is less than 34 weeks pregnant?
	1.	Contractions need to be suppressed and the patient referred urgently to a level 2 hospital.
	1.	Contractions need to be suppressed and the patient referred urgently to a level&nbsp;1 hospital.
	1.	There is no time to suppress contractions as this will only delay the urgent transfer of the patient.
	1.	If the cervix is less than 2 cm dilated it is better to wait to see if further dilatation occurs before transfer is arranged.
18.	How would you decide that a patient is less than 34 weeks pregnant if the duration of the pregnancy is unknown?
	1.	The estimated fetal weight will be less than 2500 g and the syphysis-fundus measurement will be less than 34 cm.
	1.	The estimated fetal weight will be less than 2000 g and the syphysis-fundus measurement will be less than 33 cm.
	1.	If in doubt the patient should be referred to a level 2 hospital to be evaluated.
	1.	An ultrasound examination needs to be done urgently to establish the correct gestational age.
19.	Salbutamol should not be used in a patient with:
	1.	Asthma.
	1.	Preterm rupture of the membranes.
	1.	Multiple pregnancy.
	1.	Heart valve disease.
20.	What advice should be given to a patient who had a preterm delivery?
	1.	If she only had one previous preterm delivery, there is no need to be concerned about future pregnancies.
	1.	There is a high risk of recurrence, it will be better not to attempt future pregnancies.
	1.	Intervention is only required if a patient had two previous preterm deliveries.
	1.	The patient should be seen at a level&nbsp;2 hospital before her next pregnancy to be assessed for possible causes.
