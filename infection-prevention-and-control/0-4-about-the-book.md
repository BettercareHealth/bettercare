# About the book

This publication is part of the Bettercare series which addresses the need for continuing education by providing self-managed learning opportunities to health professionals. This book was developed to expand access to education in Infection Prevention and Control for all categories of healthcare workers, especially those working in low-resource settings. The content of the book is broadly based on a five-day introductory course run by the Unit for Infection Prevention and Control at Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. 

Funding for development of this book was generously provided by the Stellenbosch University Rural Medical Education Partnership Initiative (SURMEPI) project. SURMEPI is funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR) through HRSA under the term T84HA21652. We gratefully acknowledge the input and contribution of clinical cases and multiple choice questions from Infection Prevention and Control and Infectious Diseases practitioners around the globe. Many of these colleagues have been recognised as leaders in IPC in their home countries by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America’s (SHEA) International IPC Ambassador programme.

All royalties from the sale of this book will be donated to the Infection Control Africa Network (ICAN).

We hope that you will find learning from this book enjoyable and that it will be valuable in your daily healthcare practice.
