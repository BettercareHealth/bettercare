# Test 8: Tuberculosis infection prevention and control

1.	Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is transmitted by:
	+	Airborne route
	-	Droplet route
	-	Contact transmission
	-	Blood transmission. 
2.	A recognised risk factor for the development of tuberculosis disease is:
	-	Asian race
	-	Female sex 
	+	Extremes of age (young infants and the elderly)
	-	Frequent use of public transportation.
3.	Which of these people has the highest risk for developing tuberculosis disease? 
	-	An HIV patient on antiretroviral medications whose CD4 count has normalised
	+	A diabetic 80-year-old female on steroids for her debilitating arthritis
	-	A 65-year-old hypertensive male with acute heart attack in the ICU
	-	A 28-year-old healthcare worker assigned to the TB ward wearing proper protection.
4.	Which of the following TB patients is the most infectious?
	-	A well college student found to have suspicious TB infiltrates on a chest X-ray
	-	A lady with TB of the spine
	-	A boy with TB of the lymph nodes in his neck (draining fluid containing TB bacilli)
	+	An elderly man coughing profusely (with a lung cavity from TB) who is not yet on treatment.
5.	The risk of TB transmission is determined by: 
	+	The degree and duration of TB exposure
	-	Whether the patient had received the BCG immunisation in childhood
	-	Whether the index case shared eating utensils with the exposed individuals
	-	Whether the index case is a healthcare worker. 
6.	Which of these areas in a hospital are considered high risk for TB transmission? 
	-	The cafeteria
	-	The pharmacy
	-	The operating theatres
	+	The adult medical wards.
7.	What is the advantage of the sputum smear microscopy test for TB bacilli: 
	+	It is affordable even in resource-limited settings
	-	It can detect patients with low levels of TB bacilli (pauci-bacillary disease)
	-	It can differentiate easily between various types of mycobacteria
	-	It can predict drug resistance.
8.	The term multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) implies:
	+	TB which is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin
	-	Resistance to all first line anti-TB drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol
	-	Resistant to at least four classes of anti-TB drugs
	-	Resistance acquired during the course of therapy.
9.	Which statement is true regarding drug-resistant TB (DRTB)? 
	-	DRTB is more infectious and communicable than the regular susceptible TB
	-	DRTB is treated for the same number of months as the regular susceptible TB
	-	DRTB patients convert to sputum smear-negative faster than susceptible TB
	+	DRTB is more expensive and difficult to treat than drug susceptible TB.
10.	What are the ‘3Is’ of TB prevention? 
	-	TB-IPC; Intensified directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS); Integrated contact tracing 
	-	TB-IPC, Isoniazid preventive therapy, Intensive training
	+	TB-IPC, Isoniazid preventive therapy, Intensified case finding
	-	TB-IPC, Isoniazid preventive therapy, Isolation rooms.
11.	Implementation of TB infection control in a healthcare facility is the responsibility of:
	-	TB patients
	-	The TB physicians 
	-	The hospital security workers
	+	All healthcare workers.
12.	Which of these strategies is the most important in the hierarchy of TB infection control? 
	-	Leadership control
	+	Administrative controls
	-	Environmental controls
	-	Respiratory controls.
13.	Environmental controls for TB: 
	-	Should provide healthcare workers with protective equipment
	+	Should remove, replace, dilute or clean contaminated air  
	-	Should effectively treat patients with TB with correct anti-TB medications
	-	Should provide clean and safe environments for patients with TB.
14.	Which type of ventilation is preferred in low-resource settings? 
	+	Natural ventilation
	-	Mechanical ventilation
	-	Mixed ventilation methods
	-	Positive pressure ventilation.
15.	Natural ventilation: 
	-	Involves use of air-handling units to direct the movement of air in a room
	-	Involves use of air-conditioners to recycle air in rooms 
	-	Involves supply and removal of air by electricity-dependent negative pressure systems
	+	Involves natural draughts of fresh air from the outside environment. 
16.	N95 respirators: 
	+	Have high filtering efficiency, preventing inhalation of over 95% of particulate aerosols
	-	Should be worn only when within 1 metre of a TB suspect or confirmed case
	-	Can filter out particles from 100–1000 microns in size 
	-	Should be worn by both patients and healthcare workers.
17.	N95 respirators: 
	-	Can be safely re-used over and over again up to one month
	-	Should be worn by patients to reduce TB bacilli in the environment
	+	Should be stored in dry envelopes marked with the healthcare worker’s name
	-	Can still be used even if torn, as long as a fit test has been done.
18.	When should patients with infectious TB be required to wear a surgical mask? 
	+	When TB patients are in a closed or poorly ventilated area with other persons
	-	When TB patients are in their own single rooms for long periods of time
	-	When TB patients are allowed to go outdoors 
	-	When TB patients are sent home from the hospital.
19.	Healthcare workers in high-burden TB settings are: 
	-	At low risk of acquiring TB
	-	At the same risk of acquiring TB as the general population
	-	Protected from acquiring TB by the BCG vaccine
	+	At significantly increased risk of acquiring TB from ongoing TB exposure.
20.	Patients newly diagnosed with TB should be advised that: 
	-	They must wear a surgical mask or face-cover outdoors
	-	They may sleep in the same room with young infants
	+	They should discard all tissues into a plastic bag and wash hands regularly
	-	They can stop all preventive measures after two weeks of treatment for drug-resistant TB.
