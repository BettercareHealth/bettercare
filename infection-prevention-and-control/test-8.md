# Test 8: Tuberculosis infection prevention and control

Please choose the ONE most correct answer to each question:

1.	Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is transmitted by:
	1.	Airborne route
	1.	Droplet route
	1.	Contact transmission
	1.	Blood transmission. 
2.	A recognised risk factor for the development of tuberculosis disease is:
	1.	Asian race
	1.	Female sex 
	1.	Extremes of age (young infants and the elderly)
	1.	Frequent use of public transportation.
3.	Which of these people has the highest risk for developing tuberculosis disease? 
	1.	An HIV patient on antiretroviral medications whose CD4 count has normalised
	1.	A diabetic 80-year-old female on steroids for her debilitating arthritis
	1.	A 65-year-old hypertensive male with acute heart attack in the ICU
	1.	A 28-year-old healthcare worker assigned to the TB ward wearing proper protection.
4.	Which of the following TB patients is the most infectious?
	1.	A well college student found to have a suspicious TB infiltrates on a chest X-ray
	1.	A lady with TB of the spine
	1.	A boy with TB of the lymph nodes in his neck (draining fluid containing TB bacilli)
	1.	An elderly man coughing profusely (with a lung cavity from TB) who is not yet on treatment.
5.	The risk of TB transmission is determined by: 
	1.	The degree and duration of TB exposure
	1.	Whether the patient had received the BCG immunisation in childhood
	1.	Whether the index case shared eating utensils with the exposed individuals
	1.	Whether the index case is a healthcare worker. 
6.	Which of these areas in a hospital are considered high risk for TB transmission? 
	1.	The cafeteria
	1.	The pharmacy
	1.	The operating theatres
	1.	The adult medical wards.
7.	What is the advantage of the sputum smear microscopy test for TB bacilli: 
	1.	It is affordable even in resource-limited settings
	1.	It can detect patients with low levels of TB bacilli (pauci-bacillary disease)
	1.	It can differentiate easily between various types of mycobacteria
	1.	It can predict drug resistance.
8.	The term multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) implies:
	1.	TB which is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin
	1.	Resistance to all first line anti-TB drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol
	1.	Resistant to at least four classes of anti-TB drugs
	1.	Resistance acquired during the course of therapy.
9.	Which statement is true regarding drug-resistant TB (DRTB)? 
	1.	DRTB is more infectious and communicable than the regular susceptible TB
	1.	DRTB is treated for the same number of months as the regular susceptible TB
	1.	DRTB patients convert to sputum smear-negative faster than susceptible TB
	1.	DRTB is more expensive and difficult to treat than drug susceptible TB.
10.	What are the ‘3Is’ of TB prevention? 
	1.	TB-IPC, Intensified directly observed therapy (DOTS), Integrated contact tracing 
	1.	TB-IPC, Isoniazid preventive therapy, Intensive training  
	1.	TB-IPC, Isoniazid preventive therapy, Intensified case finding
	1.	TB-IPC, Isoniazid preventive therapy, Isolation rooms.
11.	Implementation of TB infection control in a healthcare facility is the responsibility of:
	1.	TB patients
	1.	The TB physicians 
	1.	The hospital security workers
	1.	All healthcare workers.
12.	Which of these strategies is the most important in the hierarchy of TB infection control? 
	1.	Leadership control
	1.	Administrative controls
	1.	Environmental controls
	1.	Respiratory controls.
13.	Environmental controls for TB: 
	1.	Should provide healthcare workers with protective equipment
	1.	Should remove, replace, dilute or clean contaminated air  
	1.	Should effectively treat patients with TB with correct anti-TB medications
	1.	Should provide clean and safe environments for patients with TB.
14.	Which type of ventilation is preferred in low-resource settings? 
	1.	Natural ventilation
	1.	Mechanical ventilation
	1.	Mixed ventilation methods
	1.	Positive pressure ventilation.
15.	Natural ventilation: 
	1.	Involves use of air-handling units to direct the movement of air in a room
	1.	Involves use of air-conditioners to recycle air in rooms 
	1.	Involves supply and removal of air by electricity-dependent negative pressure systems
	1.	Involves natural draughts of fresh air from the outside environment. 
16.	N95 respirators: 
	1.	Have high filtering efficiency, preventing inhalation of over 95% of particulate aerosols
	1.	Should be worn only when within 1 metre of a TB suspect or confirmed case
	1.	Can filter out particles from 100–1000 microns in size 
	1.	Should be worn by both patients and healthcare workers.
17.	N95 respirators: 
	1.	Can be safely re-used over and over again up to one month
	1.	Should be worn by patients to reduce TB bacilli in the environment
	1.	Should be stored in dry envelopes marked with the healthcare worker’s name
	1.	Can still be used even if torn, as long as a fit test has been done.
18.	When should patients with infectious TB be required to wear a surgical mask? 
	1.	When TB patients are in a closed or poorly ventilated area with other persons
	1.	When TB patients are in their own single rooms for long periods of time
	1.	When TB patients are allowed to go outdoors 
	1.	When TB patients are sent home from the hospital.
19.	Healthcare workers in high-burden TB settings are: 
	1.	At low risk of acquiring TB
	1.	At the same risk of acquiring TB as the general population
	1.	Protected from acquiring TB by the BCG vaccine
	1.	At significantly increased risk of acquiring TB from ongoing TB exposure.
20.	Patients newly diagnosed with TB should be advised that: 
	1.	They must wear a surgical mask or face-cover outdoors
	1.	They may sleep in the same room with young infants
	1.	They should discard all tissues into a plastic bag and wash hands regularly
	1.	They can stop all preventive measures after two weeks of treatment for drug-resistant TB.
