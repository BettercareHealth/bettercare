# Test 9: Antimicrobial stewardship 

1.	Antimicrobial resistance is:
	-	The ability of pathogens to multiply under difficult circumstances
	-	The ability of pathogens to multiply in healthcare environments
	+	The ability of pathogens to grow in the presence of a drug that would normally kill them
	-	The ability of pathogens to overcome the human host’s immune defences.
2.	Antimicrobial resistance: 
	-	Results in better outcomes for patients
	-	Has decreased costs of treatment for common infections
	-	Is not a common problem worldwide 
	+	Makes available antimicrobials less effective and infections more difficult to treat. 
3.	The development of antimicrobial resistance is:
	-	An entirely preventable phenomenon
	+	An inevitable phenomenon as pathogens evolve and adapt to new environments
	-	Unaffected by antimicrobial usage
	-	Not a problem as new antimicrobials are being developed constantly. 
4.	Antimicrobial resistance in healthcare facilities is spread mainly by: 
	+	Poor IPC practices (including poor hand hygiene compliance)
	-	Use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal farming
	-	Inadequate environmental cleaning
	-	Exposure of pathogens to disinfectants.
5.	Patients with antimicrobial resistant infections:
	-	Are less likely to die from their infection than patients with drug-sensitive pathogens
	+	Are more likely to die from their infection than patients with drug-sensitive pathogens
	-	Have shorter duration of hospitalisation than patients with drug-sensitive pathogens 
	-	Cost less to treat than patients with drug-sensitive pathogens.
6.	Antimicrobial stewardship programmes:
	-	Aim to improve patient outcomes
	-	Raise awareness of the problem of antimicrobial resistance
	-	Encourage rational usage of antimicrobials
	+	All of the above. 
7.	The most important reason to implement antimicrobial stewardship is: 
	+	To conserve the effectiveness of antimicrobials for the future
	-	To save healthcare facilities money
	-	To limit the number of antimicrobials that doctors can prescribe
	-	To avoid patients developing side-effects from antimicrobials.
8.	The negative consequences of antibiotic overuse and misuse are called: 
	-	Consequent damage
	+	Collateral damage
	-	Concomitant damage
	-	Consequential damage.
9.	The ideal antimicrobial stewardship committee should be made up of: 
	-	Clinicians (doctors and nurse practitioners) and data managers
	-	Hospital management, a microbiologist and a senior doctor
	-	Pharmacy, the IPC practitioner and a senior doctor
	+	A manager, clinician, pharmacist, microbiologist, data manager and IPC practitioner. 
10.	Information on antimicrobial usage can be used by the stewardship committee to:
	+	Identify high usage drugs and clinical areas that use them most
	-	Punish individual ‘high-volume’ prescribers  
	-	Impose penalties on the clinical areas with highest usage
	-	Draw up local guidelines for antimicrobial usage.
11.	Essential resources needed for an antimicrobial stewardship programme include:
	-	Significant funding or financial resources from the healthcare facility
	-	An infectious diseases physician
	-	A pharmacist with training in infectious diseases
	+	An enthusiastic and dedicated antimicrobial stewardship programme committee. 
12.	Antimicrobial stewardship programmes can save healthcare facilities money by: 
	-	Saving patients’ lives 
	+	Reducing length of hospitalisation and avoiding unnecessary drug usage
	-	Preventing spread of drug-resistant pathogen
	-	Preventing colonisation of staff members with resistant pathogens.
13.	The IPC practitioner contributes to antimicrobial stewardship through: 
	+	Multiple activities that reduce the spread of resistant pathogens
	-	Reporting poor IPC practices to the healthcare facility manager 
	-	Performing daily ward rounds in the clinical areas  
	-	Advising clinicians on incorrect prescribing practices.
14.	Empiric antimicrobial therapy: 
	-	Is given routinely before appropriate microbiological specimens have been taken
	-	Consists usually of a single antimicrobial drug that targets the most likely pathogen
	+	Usually includes several anti-infective drugs that cover  the most likely causative pathogens
	-	Is continued even after the definitive cause of the infection is identified. 
15.	Targeted antimicrobial therapy:
	+	Aims to match the antimicrobial given to the specific pathogen-causing infection
	-	Uses broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover all potential pathogens 
	-	Does not require the collection of appropriate microbiological specimens
	-	Usually requires several different antimicrobials to be prescribed.
16.	Selective reporting: 
	-	Involves microbiologists phoning clinicians to inform them of drug-resistant pathogens 
	-	Presents clinicians with all possible antimicrobial treatment options for confirmed pathogens
	-	Discourages prescribers from using targeted antimicrobial therapy
	+	Presents clinicians with only the most narrow-spectrum antimicrobials that the pathogen is sensitive to. 
17.	De-escalation of antimicrobial therapy:
	-	Means changing the patient’s prescription from a narrow to a broad-spectrum antimicrobial
	-	Is potentially harmful, even if the pathogen is sensitive to a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial 
	+	Ensures effective therapy but reduces harmful effects of broad-spectrum antimicrobials  
	-	Means that therapy should be stopped or discontinued.  
18.	Prolonged courses of antimicrobials: 
	+	May encourage the development of antimicrobial resistance
	-	Do not increase the risk of side-effects for patients
	-	Are needed as prophylaxis for patients undergoing surgical procedures 
	-	Are needed for all patients with serious infections.
19.	An antimicrobial restriction policy:
	-	Prevents clinicians from accessing essential antimicrobials
	+	Limits access to selected antimicrobials, without prior approval from a senior person 
	-	Should be implemented identically at all healthcare facilities 
	-	Does not need clinicians with insight into antimicrobial management to be available.
20.	Antimicrobial prescription guidelines: 
	-	Should be based on international antimicrobial recommendations 
	-	Are unhelpful when implementing antimicrobial stewardship
	+	Give recommendations on antimicrobial selection, dose and duration based on local data 
	-	Give recommendations on which brands of antimicrobials to use.
