# Test 3: Risk assessment and risk management in IPC 

1.	Risk assessment:
	-	Is not required in the healthcare environment
	+	Is a process that identifies, evaluates and controls hazards in healthcare
	-	Is used only to identify potential hazards in healthcare 
	-	Identifies hazards to patients only.  
2.	The order of steps in a risk assessment cycle is:
	+	Identify, evaluate, assess severity, implement interventions,  continue to monitor problem
	-	Evaluate, assess severity, identify, implement interventions, continue to monitor problem
	-	Implement interventions, identify, evaluate, assess severity, continue to monitor problem
	-	Identify, continue to monitor problem, evaluate, assess severity, implement interventions.
3.	Risk assessment should be performed:
	-	When a patient is admitted to the intensive care unit
	-	Every time a needlestick injury occurs 
	+	When a new service, instrument, procedure or problem is identified 
	-	Before administering a new type of medication.
4.	Risk assessment should be performed by: 
	+	An experienced IPC practitioner with input from relevant staff
	-	An experienced clinician in charge of the ward or clinical area 
	-	The healthcare facility manager 
	-	The IPC committee at a healthcare facility.
5.	Hazards or risks in healthcare are: 
	-	Independent of the severity of consequences for a particular hazard
	+	Classified as high, medium or low risk 
	-	Classified as serious or minimal risk 
	-	Not possible to classify, as they are all of a serious nature.
6.	Implementation of risk management in healthcare:
	-	Is the responsibility of healthcare facility managers
	-	Increases the rate of healthcare-associated infections 
	-	Does not involve the IPC practitioner 
	+	Can increase the safety of patients, healthcare workers and visitors. 
7.	The purpose of risk management in healthcare is: 
	+	Improve the overall quality of care provided
	-	Implement programmes to reduce all forms of harm in healthcare 
	-	To identify staff and areas where sub-standard care is delivered 
	-	To save the healthcare facility money.
8.	Successful risk management programmes need: 
	-	Punishment for staff members who don’t comply with recommendations 
	-	A lot of financial resources to implement 
	+	Effective leadership from managers and clinician ownership 
	-	The approval of all stakeholders in the healthcare facility.
9.	The following interventions aim to reduce healthcare-associated infections: 
	+	Standard and transmission-based precautions
	-	Universal precautions 
	-	The clean hospital programme 
	-	The adverse medication events registry.
10.	Standard precautions protect: 
	-	Healthcare workers only
	-	Patients only 
	-	Visitors only 
	+	Healthcare workers, patients and visitors.
11.	Standard precautions: 
	-	Apply only to clinical staff (doctors and nurses)
	-	Apply only to patients known to have a transmissible 	-	pathogen 
	+	Reduce infection risk from both known and unrecognised sources 
	-	Are not cost-effective in reducing infections. 
12.	Transmission-based precautions: 
	+	Are implemented based on a pathogens known route/s of transmission
	-	Only one type of precaution may be implemented per patient 
	-	Are implemented in place of standard precautions after the pathogen is identified 
	-	Involve placing warnings in the patient’s medical file. 
13.	Infections spread by the droplet route include: 
	-	Tuberculosis, measles and varicella
	-	Skin and wound infections 
	-	Urinary tract infections with *E. coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae*
	+	Meningococcal meningitis and most respiratory viruses.
14.	Precautions required when nursing a newly diagnosed patient with pulmonary TB include: 
	-	Eye protection, gloves and isolation
	-	Standard precautions
	+	Airborne precautions
	-	Aprons, cohort isolation and negative pressure ventilation.
15.	Risk-prone procedures when nursing a patient with influenza pneumonitis include: 
	-	Dressing a bedsore
	-	Changing their urinary catheter bag 
	+	Inserting a naso-gastric tube 
	-	Changing a linen saver soiled with faeces.
16.	Personal protective equipment (PPE) is needed when:
	-	Re-positioning or turning a patient in their bed
	-	Feeding an infant his bottle
	-	Washing a bed-bound patient 
	+	Handling linen soiled with urine or vomitus.
17.	The major risk from unsafe injection practices is transmission of: 
	-	Malaria
	+	Blood-borne viruses 
	-	African sleeping sickness
	-	Bloodstream infections. 
18.	Safety-engineered devices: 
	+	Reduce the risk of needlestick injuries in healthcare workers
	-	Are not cost-effective  
	-	Include fixed needles and auto disable syringes
	-	Are not needed in low-resource settings as needlestick injury is uncommon.
19.	Care bundles: 
	-	Are not evidence-based 
	-	Are implemented for device-associated infections only  
	-	Require compliance to two or more bundle elements 
	+	Require buy-in and commitment from a multi-disciplinary team. 
20.	As bundle compliance increases the infection rate being monitored should: 
	-	Increase
	-	Stay the same 
	+	Decrease 
	-	Not be influenced by changes in bundle compliance.
