# Test 3: Risk assessment and risk management in IPC 

Please choose the ONE most correct answer to each question:

1.	Risk assessment:
	1.	Is not required in the healthcare environment
	1.	Is a process that identifies, evaluates and controls hazards in healthcare
	1.	Is used only to identify potential hazards in healthcare 
	1.	Identifies hazards to patients only.  
2.	The order of steps in a risk assessment cycle is:
	1.	Identify, evaluate, assess severity, implement interventions,  continue to monitor problem
	1.	Evaluate, assess severity, identify, implement interventions, continue to monitor problem
	1.	Implement interventions, identify, evaluate, assess severity, continue to monitor problem
	1.	Identify, continue to monitor problem, evaluate, assess severity, implement interventions.
3.	Risk assessment should be performed:
	1.	When a patient is admitted to the intensive care unit
	1.	Every time a needlestick injury occurs 
	1.	When a new service, instrument, procedure or problem is identified 
	1.	Before administering a new type of medication.
4.	Risk assessment should be performed by: 
	1.	An experienced IPC practitioner with input from relevant staff
	1.	An experienced clinician in charge of the ward or clinical area 
	1.	The healthcare facility manager 
	1.	The IPC committee at a healthcare facility.
5.	Hazards or risks in healthcare are: 
	1.	Independent of the severity of consequences for a particular hazard
	1.	Classified as high, medium or low risk 
	1.	Classified as serious or minimal risk 
	1.	Not possible to classify, as they are all of a serious nature.
6.	Implementation of risk management in healthcare:
	1.	Is the responsibility of healthcare facility managers
	1.	Increases the rate of healthcare-associated infections 
	1.	Does not involve the IPC practitioner 
	1.	Can increase the safety of patients, healthcare workers and visitors. 
7.	The purpose of risk management in healthcare is: 
	1.	Improve the overall quality of care provided
	1.	Implement programmes to reduce all forms of harm in healthcare 
	1.	To identify staff and areas where sub-standard care is delivered 
	1.	To save the healthcare facility money.
8.	Successful risk management programmes need: 
	1.	Punishment for staff members who don’t comply with recommendations 
	1.	A lot of financial resources to implement 
	1.	Effective leadership from managers and clinician ownership 
	1.	The approval of all stakeholders in the healthcare facility.
9.	The following interventions aim to reduce healthcare-associated infections: 
	1.	Standard and transmission-based precautions
	1.	Universal precautions 
	1.	The clean hospital programme 
	1.	The adverse medication events registry.
10.	Standard precautions protect: 
	1.	Healthcare workers only
	1.	Patients only 
	1.	Visitors only 
	1.	Healthcare workers, patients and visitors.
11.	Standard precautions: 
	1.	Apply only to clinical staff (doctors and nurses)
	1.	Apply only to patients known to have a transmissible 	1.	pathogen 
	1.	Reduce infection risk from both known and unrecognised sources 
	1.	Are not cost-effective in reducing infections. 
12.	Transmission-based precautions: 
	1.	Are implemented based on a pathogens known route/s of transmission
	1.	Only one type of precaution may be implemented per patient 
	1.	Are implemented in place of standard precautions after the pathogen is identified 
	1.	Involve placing warnings in the patient’s medical file. 
13.	Infections spread by the droplet route include: 
	1.	Tuberculosis, measles and varicella
	1.	Skin and wound infections 
	1.	Urinary tract infections with *E. coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae*
	1.	Meningococcal meningitis and most respiratory viruses.
14.	Precautions required when nursing a newly diagnosed patient with pulmonary TB include: 
	1.	Eye protection, gloves and isolation
	1.	Standard precautions
	1.	Airborne precautions
	1.	Aprons, cohort isolation and negative pressure ventilation.
15.	Risk-prone procedures when nursing a patient with influenza pneumonitis include: 
	1.	Dressing a bedsore
	1.	Changing their urinary catheter bag 
	1.	Inserting a naso-gastric tube 
	1.	Changing a linen saver soiled with faeces.
16.	Personal protective equipment (PPE) is needed when:
	1.	Re-positioning or turning a patient in their bed
	1.	Feeding an infant his bottle
	1.	Washing a bed-bound patient 
	1.	Handling linen soiled with urine or vomitus.
17.	The major risk from unsafe injection practices is transmission of: 
	1.	Malaria
	1.	Blood-borne viruses 
	1.	African sleeping sickness
	1.	Bloodstream infections. 
18.	Safety-engineered devices: 
	1.	Reduce the risk of needlestick injuries in healthcare workers
	1.	Are not cost-effective  
	1.	Include fixed needles and auto disable syringes
	1.	Are not needed in low-resource settings as needlestick injury is uncommon.
19.	Care bundles: 
	1.	Are not evidence-based 
	1.	Are implemented for device-associated infections only  
	1.	Require compliance to two or more bundle elements 
	1.	Require buy-in and commitment from a multi-disciplinary team. 
20.	As bundle compliance increases the infection rate being monitored should: 
	1.	Increase
	1.	Stay the same 
	1.	Decrease 
	1.	Not be influenced by changes in bundle compliance.
