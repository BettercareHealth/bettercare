# Test 7: Surveillance and outbreak investigation

1.	Surveillance can best be described as:
	+	A method to track infections in a healthcare facility
	-	A way to record the numbers of patients attending a primary care clinic
	-	A way to record how many sterile packs are being stored in an operating theatre
	-	Random data collection with no specific purpose.
2.	The purpose of conducting surveillance for healthcare-associated infection is:
	-	To keep the facility manager satisfied 
	+	To establish infection rates before implementing an IPC intervention 
	-	To give the IPC practitioner something to do when infection is not a problem
	-	To identify which areas of a healthcare facility are the dirtiest.
3.	Surveillance for healthcare-associated infection should be conducted by: 
	-	Only the IPC practitioner 
	+	A team of people with the relevant skills
	-	The microbiology service
	-	The data manager.
4.	Surveillance programmes for healthcare-associated infection should be conducted at:
	-	Community level
	+	Facility, provincial or national level
	-	Individual pathogen level 
	-	Individual patient level.
5.	Healthcare-associated infection surveillance programmes require: 
	-	Large amounts of money to implement
	+	Standardised surveillance definitions 
	-	A microbiologist to interpret the findings
	-	A biostatistician to analyse the data.
6.	A disadvantage of conducting continuous surveillance is: 
	+	That it is very time-consuming
	-	It does not allow for comparison of changes over time
	-	It cannot identify outbreaks
	-	It is not useful for establishing baseline infection rates.
7.	Point prevalence surveillance studies:
	-	Require ongoing, continuous data collection for specific infections
	-	May not be repeated periodically 
	-	Require more resources than continuous surveillance
	+	Provide a snapshot of disease burden at one point in time.
8.	The following IPC indicators are an outcome measure:
	-	The percentage of staff that receive an annual influenza vaccination
	+	The healthcare-associated infection rate
	-	The hand hygiene compliance rate
	-	The percentage of surgical patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis on time.
9.	Data on healthcare-associated infection are usually presented as a:
	-	Proportion
	-	Percentage
	+	Rate
	-	Numerator.
10.	Healthcare-associated infection rates in low-income countries are:
	-	Lower than in high-income countries
	-	Similar to high-income countries
	+	Higher than high-income countries 
	-	Not known. 
11.	A commonly used definition of an outbreak is:
	-	One or more linked cases with the same symptoms
	-	More than four linked cases with similar symptoms
	+	More cases in a population than expected
	-	A rapidly spreading type of infectious disease.
12.	In outbreak terminology a vehicle is defined as:
	+	A non-living intermediary that can transmit pathogens, e.g. food
	-	A living intermediary that can transmit pathogens, e.g. ticks
	-	The site where a pathogen grows and multiplies
	-	A motorised form of transport that can translocate pathogens, e.g. mosquitoes on aeroplanes.
13.	In outbreak terminology, an epidemic is defined as:
	-	The usual or expected level of disease in an area
	+	Disease levels greater than normally expected, more prolonged/widespread than outbreaks
	-	A disease that has spread to all regions of the world
	-	The study of the epidemiology of infectious diseases.
14.	Outbreaks are usually recognised by:
	-	Conducting point prevalence surveys
	-	Reports in the media of people dying under mysterious circumstances
	+	Reports from clinicians or the laboratory of an increased frequency of a particular disease  
	-	Analysing data on notifiable diseases on an annual basis. 
15.	The main purpose of outbreak investigation is to: 
	+	Identify the source of the illness and guide efforts to stop the outbreak
	-	Find someone to blame for the spread of the outbreak
	-	Train healthcare workers about public health programmes
	-	Help the local government to prioritise service upgrades, e.g. water, sanitation.
16.	Six babies develop diarrhoea on the neonatal ward. The first step in outbreak investigation is: 
	-	To draw up a line list and Gantt chart
	-	To send stool samples to microbiology and virology laboratories
	+	To call an urgent meeting with paediatrics, infection control and facility management
	-	To agree on a case definition for the outbreak.
17.	The immediate control measures needed in an outbreak are:
	-	The formation of an outbreak response team
	-	Development of a case definition
	-	Alerting of all possible role players
	+	Reinforcement of IPC measures. 
18.	In outbreak investigation, a line list is used to:
	-	Keep track of all staff who were in contact with the disease-affected patients
	+	Record details of all patients who meet the outbreak case definition
	-	Track patient movements within a healthcare facility 
	-	Record which specimens have been sent to the laboratory for each patient.
19.	When the outbreak has been successfully contained, the outbreak team should: 
	-	Congratulate each other on a job well done
	-	Inform the facility manager or communicable disease officer
	+	Prepare and distribute a report summarising their findings and recommendations
	-	Tell the laboratory to destroy all the samples/specimens. 
20.	The role of the IPC practitioner in outbreak investigation is:
	-	To act as the spokesperson and liaise with the media
	+	To co-ordinate evaluation of relevant IPC policies and implement IPC control measures
	-	To take responsibility for leading the outbreak team
	-	To provide clinical care to people affected by the outbreak.
