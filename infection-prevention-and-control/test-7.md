# Test 7: Surveillance and outbreak investigation

Please choose the ONE most correct answer to each question:

1.	Surveillance can best be described as:
	1.	A method to track infections in a healthcare facility
	1.	A way to record the numbers of patients attending a primary care clinic
	1.	A way to record how many sterile packs are being stored in an operating theatre
	1.	Random data collection with no specific purpose.
2.	The purpose of conducting surveillance for healthcare-associated infection is:
	1.	To keep the facility manager satisfied 
	1.	To establish infection rates before implementing an IPC intervention 
	1.	To give the IPC practitioner something to do when infection is not a problem
	1.	To identify which areas of a healthcare facility are the dirtiest.
3.	Surveillance for healthcare-associated infection should be conducted by: 
	1.	Only the IPC practitioner 
	1.	A team of people with the relevant skills
	1.	The microbiology service
	1.	The data manager.
4.	Surveillance programmes for healthcare-associated infection should be conducted at:
	1.	Community level
	1.	Facility, provincial or national level
	1.	Individual pathogen level 
	1.	Individual patient level.
5.	Healthcare-associated infection surveillance programmes require: 
	1.	Large amounts of money to implement
	1.	Standardised surveillance definitions 
	1.	A microbiologist to interpret the findings
	1.	A biostatistician to analyse the data.
6.	A disadvantage of conducting continuous surveillance is: 
	1.	That it is very time-consuming
	1.	It does not allow for comparison of changes over time
	1.	It cannot identify outbreaks
	1.	It is not useful for establishing baseline infection rates.
7.	Point prevalence surveillance studies:
	1.	Require ongoing, continuous data collection for specific infections
	1.	May not be repeated periodically 
	1.	Require more resources than continuous surveillance
	1.	Provide a snapshot of disease burden at one point in time.
8.	The following IPC indicators are an outcome measure:
	1.	The percentage of staff that receive an annual influenza vaccination
	1.	The healthcare-associated infection rate
	1.	The hand hygiene compliance rate
	1.	The percentage of surgical patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis on time.
9.	Data on healthcare-associated infection are usually presented as a:
	1.	Proportion
	1.	Percentage
	1.	Rate
	1.	Numerator.
10.	Healthcare-associated infection rates in low-income countries are:
	1.	Lower than in high-income countries
	1.	Similar to high-income countries
	1.	Higher than high-income countries 
	1.	Not known. 
11.	A commonly used definition of an outbreak is:
	1.	One or more linked cases with the same symptoms
	1.	More than four linked cases with similar symptoms
	1.	More cases in a population than expected
	1.	A rapidly spreading type of infectious disease.
12.	In outbreak terminology a vehicle is defined as:
	1.	A non-living intermediary that can transmit pathogens, e.g. food
	1.	A living intermediary that can transmit pathogens, e.g. ticks
	1.	The site where a pathogen grows and multiplies
	1.	A motorised form of transport that can translocate pathogens, e.g. mosquitos on aeroplanes.
13.	In outbreak terminology, an epidemic is defined as:
	1.	The usual or expected level of disease in an area
	1.	Disease levels greater than normally expected, more prolonged/widespread than outbreaks
	1.	A disease that has spread to all regions of the world
	1.	The study of the epidemiology of infectious diseases.
14.	Outbreaks are usually recognised by:
	1.	Conducting point prevalence surveys
	1.	Reports in the media of people dying under mysterious circumstances
	1.	Reports from clinicians or the laboratory of an increased frequency of a particular disease  
	1.	Analysing data on notifiable diseases on an annual basis. 
15.	The main purpose of outbreak investigation is to: 
	1.	Identify the source of the illness and guide efforts to stop the outbreak
	1.	Find someone to blame for the spread of the outbreak
	1.	Train healthcare workers about public health programmes
	1.	Help the local government to prioritise service upgrades, e.g. water, sanitation.
16.	Six babies develop diarrhoea on the neonatal ward. The first step in outbreak investigation is: 
	1.	To draw up a line list and Gantt chart
	1.	To send stool samples to microbiology and virology laboratories
	1.	To call an urgent meeting with paediatrics, infection control and facility management
	1.	To agree on a case definition for the outbreak.
17.	The immediate control measures needed in an outbreak are:
	1.	The formation of an outbreak response team
	1.	Development of a case definition
	1.	Alerting of all possible role players
	1.	Reinforcement of IPC measures. 
18.	In outbreak investigation, a line list is used to:
	1.	Keep track of all staff who were in contact with the disease-affected patients
	1.	Record details of all patients who meet the outbreak case definition
	1.	Track patient movements within a healthcare facility 
	1.	Record which specimens have been sent to the laboratory for each patient.
19.	When the outbreak has been successfully contained, the outbreak team should: 
	1.	Congratulate each other on a job well done
	1.	Inform the facility manager or communicable disease officer
	1.	Prepare and distribute a report summarising their findings and recommendations
	1.	Tell the laboratory to destroy all the samples/specimens. 
20.	The role of the IPC practitioner in outbreak investigation is:
	1.	To act as the spokesperson and liaise with the media
	1.	To co-ordinate evaluation of relevant IPC policies and implement IPC control measures
	1.	To take responsibility for leading the outbreak team
	1.	To provide clinical care to people affected by the outbreak.
