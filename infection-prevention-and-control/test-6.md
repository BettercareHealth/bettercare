# Test 6: Environmental cleaning, waste management and decontamination of medical devices 

Please choose the ONE most correct answer to each question:

1.	Infection can be easily transmitted from:
	1.	Inadequately cleaned healthcare environments 
	1.	Properly sterilized medical instruments 
	1.	Clean and dry surfaces
	1.	Single-use medical devices.
2.	Environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities should be:
	1.	Carpeted to reduce the noise levels.
	1.	Non-compatible with hospital detergents and disinfectants
	1.	Rough and porous
	1.	Easy to clean.
3.	Domestic or cleaning staff:
	1.	Require appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) suitable for their work
	1.	Require immunisation against meningitis
	1.	Do not need to undergo IPC training
	1.	Are not at risk of acquiring infections from patients. 
4.	Regarding frequently touched areas: 
	1.	Micro-organisms are easily transferred from people’s hands to surfaces
	1.	The closer the surface to the patient, the lower the chance of pathogen transfer to the patient
	1.	No special attention should be paid when cleaning these areas
	1.	Surfaces get wiped clean by those that touch them.
5.	Terminal room cleaning is required for patients with: 
	1.	A community-acquired pneumonia
	1.	Pulmonary mycobacterium tuberculosis (pTB)
	1.	A myocardial infarction
	1.	A fungal toe-nail infection.
6.	The terminal cleaning process requires:
	1.	Routine cleaning of the room
	1.	Re-carpeting or re-tiling of the room
	1.	Repainting of the room
	1.	Removal of all linen, consumables and PPE plus cleaning, wiping down with disinfectant.
7.	Accidents and blood spills should be handled as follows:   
	1.	A written procedure should be available for management of accidents and spills
	1.	Personal protective equipment is not needed when cleaning spills
	1.	Blood spills should be wiped over with chlorine at concentration 100 parts per million
	1.	Chlorine should be applied directly to the spill so as to avoid touching the surface.
8.	Training in healthcare waste management should be provided to:
	1.	Cleaners/domestic staff
	1.	Radiographers
	1.	Pharmacists
	1.	All healthcare facility staff.
9.	Effective management of clinical waste involves:
	1.	Source segregation of waste into robust, colour-coded plastic bags
	1.	A waste storage area that is accessible to all staff and visitors
	1.	Incineration of all types of waste
	1.	Highly mechanised systems of moving clinical waste from point of generation to disposal.
10.	There is a high risk of sharps or needlestick injury to staff when:   
	1.	Sharps containers are mounted on the wall
	1.	Puncture-proof containers are used
	1.	Sharps containers are filled higher than indicated two-thirds full mark
	1.	Sharps containers are located within easy reach of the clinician.
11.	The cleaning process for reprocessing used medical devices:
	1.	Physically removes soil and organic matter, with bacteria and viruses
	1.	Kills and destroys almost all pathogens
	1.	Is capable of killing spores
	1.	Is capable of killing prions.
12.	According to the Spaulding classification:
	1.	Endoscopes are critical devices
	1.	Surgical instruments are critical devices
	1.	Blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes are semi-critical devices
	1.	The operating theatre floor is seen as semi-critical.
13.	When processing medical devices:
	1.	The device can be reliably disinfected without needing prior cleaning
	1.	Devices should be soaked to allow the disinfectant to penetrate organic matter
	1.	Soaking gives a sense of security that the item is safe to re-use
	1.	Cleaning must precede any other step of reprocessing.
14.	Cleaning of medical devices:
	1.	Does not require wearing of any personal protective equipment (PPE)
	1.	Can be effective without the need to disassemble equipment
	1.	Should be done with a soft nylon brush to scrub the device below the water level
	1.	Involves leaving the cleaned device soaking in water until needed for use on a patient.
15.	Disinfection of medical devices:
	1.	Destroys all micro-organisms
	1.	Is best achieved using chemical disinfectants
	1.	Eliminates the need for prior cleaning of devices
	1.	Reduces pathogens to levels not harmful to health.
16.	Disinfectants:
	1.	Both alcohol and chlorine disinfectants are effective at killing *Clostridium difficile*
	1.	Are used for killing pathogens on live tissue
	1.	Act rapidly to kill pathogens
	1.	Have no known side-effects. 
17.	The ideal disinfectant should:
	1.	Leave a visible mark to show it has worked 
	1.	Have a rapid onset of action
	1.	Be safe for use on live tissue
	1.	Be corrosive to surfaces.
18.	The sterile services department (SSD) should: 
	1.	Process all critical and semi-critical items in a hospital
	1.	Have a single large room where “clean” and “dirty” instruments are processed
	1.	Be operated by cleaners in the wash room
	1.	Routinely allow operating theatre staff to process instruments in the surgical area.
19.	An advantage of autoclave sterilizers is:
	1.	They do not require trained staff to operate
	1.	They can be used for all medical devices
	1.	They are cheaper to purchase than disinfectants
	1.	They have a rapid process leaving no toxic residue.
20.	Validation of autoclave sterilizers uses:  
	1.	The Bart Dickson test
	1.	Swabbing the instruments for bacterial contamination
	1.	Visual inspection for cleanliness of the instruments
	1.	Physical, biological and chemical indicators.
