# Test 6: Environmental cleaning, waste management and decontamination of medical devices 

1.	Infection can be easily transmitted from:
	+	Inadequately cleaned healthcare environments 
	-	Properly sterilized medical instruments 
	-	Clean and dry surfaces
	-	Single-use medical devices.
2.	Environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities should be:
	-	Carpeted to reduce the noise levels.
	-	Non-compatible with hospital detergents and disinfectants
	-	Rough and porous
	+	Easy to clean.
3.	Domestic or cleaning staff:
	+	Require appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) suitable for their work
	-	Require immunisation against meningitis
	-	Do not need to undergo IPC training
	-	Are not at risk of acquiring infections from patients. 
4.	Regarding frequently touched areas: 
	+	Micro-organisms are easily transferred from people’s hands to surfaces
	-	The closer the surface to the patient, the lower the chance of pathogen transfer to the patient
	-	No special attention should be paid when cleaning these areas
	-	Surfaces get wiped clean by those that touch them.
5.	Terminal room cleaning is required for patients with: 
	-	A community-acquired pneumonia
	+	Pulmonary mycobacterium tuberculosis (PTB)
	-	A myocardial infarction
	-	A fungal toe-nail infection.
6.	The terminal cleaning process requires:
	-	Routine cleaning of the room
	-	Re-carpeting or re-tiling of the room
	-	Repainting of the room
	+	Removal of all linen, consumables and PPE plus cleaning, wiping down with disinfectant.
7.	Accidents and blood spills should be handled as follows:   
	+	A written procedure should be available for management of accidents and spills
	-	Personal protective equipment is not needed when cleaning spills
	-	Blood spills should be wiped over with chlorine at concentration 100 parts per million
	-	Chlorine should be applied directly to the spill so as to avoid touching the surface.
8.	Training in healthcare waste management should be provided to:
	-	Cleaners/domestic staff
	-	Radiographers
	-	Pharmacists
	+	All healthcare facility staff.
9.	Effective management of clinical waste involves:
	+	Source segregation of waste into robust, colour-coded plastic bags
	-	A waste storage area that is accessible to all staff and visitors
	-	Incineration of all types of waste
	-	Highly mechanised systems of moving clinical waste from point of generation to disposal.
10.	There is a high risk of sharps or needlestick injury to staff when:   
	-	Sharps containers are mounted on the wall
	-	Puncture-proof containers are used
	+	Sharps containers are filled higher than indicated two-thirds full mark
	-	Sharps containers are located within easy reach of the clinician.
11.	The cleaning process for reprocessing used medical devices:
	+	Physically removes soil and organic matter, with bacteria and viruses
	-	Kills and destroys almost all pathogens
	-	Is capable of killing spores
	-	Is capable of killing prions.
12.	According to the Spaulding classification:
	-	Endoscopes are critical devices
	+	Surgical instruments are critical devices
	-	Blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes are semi-critical devices
	-	The operating theatre floor is seen as semi-critical.
13.	When processing medical devices:
	-	The device can be reliably disinfected without needing prior cleaning
	-	Devices should be soaked to allow the disinfectant to penetrate organic matter
	-	Soaking gives a sense of security that the item is safe to re-use
	+	Cleaning must precede any other step of reprocessing.
14.	Cleaning of medical devices:
	-	Does not require wearing of any personal protective equipment (PPE)
	-	Can be effective without the need to disassemble equipment
	+	Should be done with a soft nylon brush to scrub the device below the water level
	-	Involves leaving the cleaned device soaking in water until needed for use on a patient.
15.	Disinfection of medical devices:
	-	Destroys all micro-organisms
	-	Is best achieved using chemical disinfectants
	-	Eliminates the need for prior cleaning of devices
	+	Reduces pathogens to levels not harmful to health.
16.	Disinfectants:
	-	Both alcohol and chlorine disinfectants are effective at killing *Clostridium difficile*
	-	Are used for killing pathogens on live tissue
	+	Act rapidly to kill pathogens
	-	Have no known side-effects. 
17.	The ideal disinfectant should:
	-	Leave a visible mark to show it has worked 
	+	Have a rapid onset of action
	-	Be safe for use on live tissue
	-	Be corrosive to surfaces.
18.	The sterile services department (SSD) should: 
	+	Process all critical and semi-critical items in a hospital
	-	Have a single large room where ‘clean’ and ‘dirty’ instruments are processed
	-	Be operated by cleaners in the wash room
	-	Routinely allow operating theatre staff to process instruments in the surgical area.
19.	An advantage of autoclave sterilizers is:
	-	They do not require trained staff to operate
	-	They can be used for all medical devices
	-	They are cheaper to purchase than disinfectants
	+	They have a rapid process leaving no toxic residue.
20.	Validation of autoclave sterilizers uses:  
	-	The Bart Dickson test
	-	Swabbing the instruments for bacterial contamination
	-	Visual inspection for cleanliness of the instruments
	+	Physical, biological and chemical indicators.
