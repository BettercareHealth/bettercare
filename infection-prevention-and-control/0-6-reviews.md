# Reviews

‘Despite being one of the most cost-effective health interventions available, infection prevention and control has long been neglected in resource-limited settings – the very place where it is needed most.  

This pragmatic guide offers a comprehensive overview of key knowledge elements and management principles required by healthcare workers.  It is packaged in a user-friendly format that facilitates in-service training and adult learning.  

A book of this kind is long overdue and should appeal to a wide audience in both the developed and developing world.’  

—*Professor Ben J Marais, Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, University of Sydney, Australia*

‘This excellent guide on infection prevention and control is clearly written in simple and understandable language and is suitable for healthcare workers at all levels. It provides an explanation of terms and practices which are then nicely demonstrated by practical case reports. Finally the reader can test their understanding and knowledge gained with multiple choice questions.

The book is comprehensive and covers every important aspect of infection prevention and control in different healthcare settings. It is an easy guide for healthcare workers dealing with IPC issues to refer to on a daily basis.

In my opinion it is not only a must-read for all undergraduate nursing and medical students, but also for all qualified nurses and doctors. Although for the latter it may be obvious things, it is often the obvious that is most often neglected and this book will reinforce the basic IPC measures that we ALL in healthcare should know and be practicing.’

—*Professor Simon Schaaf, Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Stellenbosch University, South Africa*

‘This book highlights a critical dimension of quality in healthcare: SAFETY. 

In the current South African healthcare context, challenged with resource constraints and limited related technical expertise, this book offers a much needed knowledge guide with a difference. Its comprehensive scope, detailed, easy-to-understand narrative and practical focus reflects an insight and understanding of the status quo and operational challenges of infection prevention and control practices within our local healthcare industry. It also highlights infection prevention control as a key management function to drive quality improvement and safety for all. 

If coordinated effectively, the utilization of this critical resource will have far-reaching benefits, especially in low resource healthcare settings. I am excited at the prospect of having this book available as a resource for healthcare workers in district health services.’

—*Zulfa Francis, Quality Manager, Metro District Health Services, Western Cape Department of Health*

‘Infection prevention and control is one of those facets of healthcare that everyone acknowledges is vital, but always seems to be ‘someone else’s job’. Infection control is everyone’s responsibility and it is incumbent on all healthcare professionals to have an understanding of basic IPC principles. 

This book is a well-written, well-structured resource that could be used by both undergraduate and qualified clinicians, nurses and allied health professionals. 

The chapters all contain concise learning points, backed up with case studies, and with a self-assessment tool at the end of the book. The important aspects of infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities are all covered, as well as a section on antimicrobial stewardship. 

I would recommend this book to any health care professional with an interest in infection prevention and control.’ 

—*Professor Andrew Whitelaw, Head of Department of Medical Microbiology, National Health Laboratory Service, Cape Town, South Africa*

‘This excellent and invaluable guide on infection prevention and control is well written in a simple, accurate, understandable and user-friendly format suitable for all healthcare workers. I find it comprehensive, demonstrative and covering most, if not all, basic and critical aspects of infection prevention and control. 

It is a practical guide that offers a comprehensive overview of key concepts, essential knowledge and management principles required by infection prevention and control professionals as well as all healthcare workers.

It is one of the must-read texts for all medical and nursing undergraduate students, in addition to medical, nursing and support services staff in different healthcare settings.’

—*Professor Ossama Rasslan, Vice-Chair, Infection Control Africa Network (ICAN), President, APIC/Egypt Chapter (Egyptian Society for Infection Control ESIC)*

‘This book is a valuable and timely contribution to the global effort to strengthen infection prevention and control, as well as the management of disease outbreaks, in healthcare settings.  It is bolstered both by the contributors’ first-hand experience of clinical practice in low-resource settings and their deep understanding of the subject under consideration. The application of modern adult learning principles has resulted in an innovative learning resource on evidence-based infection prevention and control that will prove to be invaluable companion for health workers working in LMIC’s.’

—*Professor Jimmy Volmink, Dean, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University*

‘An essential guide for infection prevention and control for all health practitioners working in resource- limited areas. It is comprehensive, easy to follow, beautifully illustrated and contains very practical case studies. This guide covers not only the more conventional IPC topics but has excellent chapters on the critical areas of antibiotic stewardship and tuberculosis transmission.’

—*Professor Lucille Blumberg, Deputy Director, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), Division of Public Health Surveillance and Response, Johannesburg, South Africa*

‘This is a very comprehensive and clearly-written infection prevention and control manual applicable to all healthcare workers. 

Practical and clearly laid out, this manual covers all aspects of infection prevention and control in a systematic way. The practical case studies at the end of each chapter assist in understanding the contents of the chapter and bring theory closer to practice. They also enable the readers to establish how much they have understood. The multiple choice questions are an ideal way to test the knowledge of the reader. 

In my opinion it is an excellent manual for self-study for all healthcare workers and an ideal tool for use in in-service training.’

—*Briёtte du Toit, Infection Prevention and Control Specialist, Mediclinic Southern Africa*

‘An excellent guide for healthcare professionals working in infection prevention and control. 

Written in clear, simple and understandable language for healthcare workers, it provides all basic information and skills with practical examples and case reports. This book is not only helpful for students, junior nurses and doctors in the field but also for senior personnel at all levels of healthcare. A book like this should be read by those working in infection prevention and control in both the developed and developing world.’
