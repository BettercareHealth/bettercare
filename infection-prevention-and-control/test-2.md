# Test 2: Micro-organisms of relevance to infection prevention and control

1.	Micro-organisms are:
	-	Visible to the naked eye
	-	All harmful to human health
	-	Only found on humans and family
	+	Very small, single or multi-celled life forms.
2.	Pathogens are: 
	+	Micro-organisms that can cause disease in humans
	-	Not able to overcome the body’s immune defences
	-	Not transferrable from one person to another 
	-	Not harmful to human health. 
3.	Bacteria are easily recognisable under the microscope because they: 
	-	Move about slowly
	-	Stain yellow or green with Gram stain
	-	Form into long string-like filaments
	+	Follow particular grouping or clustering patterns.
4.	The most common method used to stain bacteria for identification under the microscope is: 
	-	The Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain
	-	The methylene blue stain
	+	The Gram stain
	-	The carbol fuchsin stain.
5.	The Gram stain can assist with bacterial identification by: 
	-	Identifying the growth requirements of the bacteria
	+	Differentiating Gram-positive from Gram-negative organisms by colour
	-	Identifying which bacteria are antibiotic-resistant
	-	Identifying whether bacteria are pathogens or not.
6.	Regarding growth of bacteria:
	+	Bacteria need the right nutrients, humidity and temperature to multiply
	-	Bacteria can replicate as fast as every two minutes
	-	Bacteria can only grow if oxygen is available
	-	The phase of rapid bacterial growth is called the ‘lag phase’. 
7.	Regarding viruses:
	-	Most viruses infect cells of the endocrine system
	-	Viruses with an envelope are more difficult to kill
	+	Viruses can only survive inside of the host’s cells (intracellularly)
	-	Most viruses are not easily transmissible.
8.	What is the main route of infection transmission in healthcare facilities? 
	-	Respiratory transmission
	+	Contact transmission
	-	Inoculation
	-	Ingestion.
9.	Which of the following are required for an infection to be transmitted?
	-	A host with a good immune system
	-	The bacteria must be Gram positive
	-	The bacteria must be Gram negative
	+	An infectious agent or pathogen.
10.	What is the chain of infection?
	+	The sequence in which an infection is transmitted from its reservoir to its host
	-	The list of people who have been linked to an outbreak of infectious disease 
	-	The route by which a particular infection is spread 
	-	A theory about how infectious disease outbreaks are started.
11.	With regard to colonisation:
	-	The host’s normal flora provide no protection against colonisation 
	+	Colonising micro-organisms can be potentially transmitted to others
	-	Colonisation always results in development of infection
	-	Carriage of colonising micro-organisms is lifelong.
12.	Micro-organisms cause disease in the host by: 
	-	Causing local inflammation 
	-	Using up nutrients needed by the normal flora
	+	Using their virulence factors to overcome the host’s defences
	-	Multiplying until their growth is out of control.
13.	With regard to host invasion by micro-organisms:
	-	Endogenous micro-organisms cannot invade the host and cause infection
	-	Colonising micro-organisms cannot invade the host and cause infection 
	-	The host has no way to prevent infection after microbial invasion has occurred 
	+	A weakened immune system puts the host at higher risk of microbial invasion.
14.	Normal flora:	
	+	Are micro-organisms that live in and on the human body without causing infection
	-	Only live on the body for short periods of time (hours)
	-	Are not affected by antibiotic use in the host
	-	Cannot be transferred from person-to-person by close contact. 
15.	Factors that increase the likelihood of healthcare-associated infection are:
	-	Many empty hospital beds
	-	A very tight control of antibiotic use
	-	Handrubs rather than hand sprays
	+	The presence of indwelling devices, e.g. drips, urinary catheters.
16.	Healthcare-associated infections: 
	-	Occur less than 48 hours after admission to hospital
	+	Include site-specific and device-associated infections
	-	Do not include gastrointestinal tract infections that develop in hospital
	-	Do not include respiratory tract infections that develop in hospital.
17.	Standard precautions:  
	-	Reduce the chance of infection transmission from known sources of infection only
	-	Are the specific precautions taken to prevent droplet transmission of infection 
	+	Should be applied to all patients, by all healthcare workers, at all times  
	-	Should only be applied when there is an obvious infection risk, e.g. a blood spill. 
18.	The laboratory has an important role to play in infection control by: 	
	-	Informing IPC and healthcare staff of patients with transmissible pathogens
	-	Assisting clinicians with rational selection of antibiotics/antibiotic stewardship
	-	Assisting IPC practitioners with outbreak investigation 
	+	All of the above.
19.	Meaningful microbiology laboratory results can be obtained when: 	
	-	The sample is kept on ice while in transit.
	+	Appropriate aseptic technique is used during specimen collection
	-	The specimen is delayed in transit to the laboratory
	-	The attending doctor asks a student to obtain the specimen.
20.	When interpreting microbiology culture results: 
	-	All cultured pathogens should be treated with appropriate antibiotics 
	-	The possibility of culture contamination is very small
	+	The pathogen cultured should be interpreted in the context of the patient’s clinical picture 
	-	The possibility of colonisation rather than infection is not worth considering.
