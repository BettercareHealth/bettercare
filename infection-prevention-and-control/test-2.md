# Test 2: Micro-organisms of relevance to infection prevention and control

Please choose the ONE most correct answer to each question:

1.	Micro-organisms are:
	1.	Visible to the naked eye
	1.	All harmful to human health
	1.	Only found on humans and family
	1.	Very small, single or multi-celled life forms.
2.	Pathogens are: 
	1.	Micro-organisms that can cause disease in humans
	1.	Not able to overcome the body’s immune defences
	1.	Not transferrable from one person to another 
	1.	Not harmful to human health. 
3.	Bacteria are easily recognisable under the microscope because they: 
	1.	Move about slowly
	1.	Stain yellow or green with Gram stain
	1.	Form into long string-like filaments
	1.	Follow particular grouping or clustering patterns.
4.	The most common method used to stain bacteria for identification under the microscope is: 
	1.	The Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain
	1.	The methylene blue stain
	1.	The Gram stain
	1.	The carbol fuschin stain.
5.	The Gram stain can assist with bacterial identification by: 
	1.	Identifying the growth requirements of the bacteria
	1.	Differentiating Gram-positive from Gram-negative organisms by colour
	1.	Identifying which bacteria are antibiotic-resistant
	1.	Identifying whether bacteria are pathogens or not.
6.	Regarding growth of bacteria:
	1.	Bacteria need the right nutrients, humidity and temperature to multiply
	1.	Bacteria can replicate as fast as every two minutes
	1.	Bacteria can only grow if oxygen is available
	1.	The phase of rapid bacterial growth is called the “lag phase”. 
7.	Regarding viruses:
	1.	Most viruses infect cells of the endocrine system
	1.	Viruses with an envelope are more difficult to kill
	1.	Viruses can only survive inside of the host’s cells (intracellularly)
	1.	Most viruses are not easily transmissible.
8.	What is the main route of infection transmission in healthcare facilities? 
	1.	Respiratory transmission
	1.	Contact transmission
	1.	Inoculation
	1.	Ingestion.
9.	Which of the following are required for an infection to be transmitted?
	1.	A host with a good immune system
	1.	The bacteria must be Gram positive
	1.	The bacteria must be Gram negative
	1.	An infectious agent or pathogen.
10.	What is the chain of infection?
	1.	The sequence in which an infection is transmitted from its reservoir to its host
	1.	The list of people who have been linked to an outbreak of infectious disease 
	1.	The route by which a particular infection is spread 
	1.	A theory about how infectious disease outbreaks are started.
11.	With regard to colonisation:
	1.	The host’s normal flora provide no protection against colonisation 
	1.	Colonising micro-organisms can be potentially transmitted to others
	1.	Colonisation always results in development of infection
	1.	Carriage of colonising micro-organisms is lifelong.
12.	Micro-organisms cause disease in the host by: 
	1.	Causing local inflammation 
	1.	Using up nutrients needed by the normal flora
	1.	Using their virulence factors to overcome the host’s defences
	1.	Multiplying until their growth is out of control.
13.	With regard to host invasion by micro-organisms:
	1.	Endogenous micro-organisms cannot invade the host and cause infection
	1.	Colonising micro-organisms cannot invade the host and cause infection 
	1.	The host has no way to prevent infection after microbial invasion has occurred 
	1.	A weakened immune system puts the host at higher risk of microbial invasion.
14.	Normal flora:	
	1.	Are micro-organisms that live in and on the human body without causing infection
	1.	Only live on the body for short periods of time (hours)
	1.	Are not affected by antibiotic use in the host
	1.	Cannot be transferred from person-to-person by close contact. 
15.	Factors that increase the likelihood of healthcare-associated infection are:
	1.	Many empty hospital beds
	1.	A very tight control of antibiotic use
	1.	Handrubs rather than hand sprays
	1.	The presence of indwelling devices, e.g. drips, urinary catheters.
16.	Healthcare-associated infections: 
	1.	Occur less than 48 hours after admission to hospital
	1.	Include site-specific and device-associated infections
	1.	Do not include gastrointestinal tract infections that develop in hospital
	1.	Do not include respiratory tract infections that develop in hospital.
17.	Standard precautions:  
	1.	Reduce the chance of infection transmission from known sources of infection only
	1.	Are the specific precautions taken to prevent droplet transmission of infection 
	1.	Should be applied to all patients, by all healthcare workers, at all times  
	1.	Should only be applied when there is an obvious infection risk, e.g. a blood spill. 
18.	The laboratory has an important role to play in infection control by: 	
	1.	Informing IPC and healthcare staff of patients with transmissible pathogens
	1.	Assisting clinicians with rational selection of antibiotics/antibiotic stewardship
	1.	Assisting IPC practitioners with outbreak investigation 
	1.	All of the above.
19.	Meaningful microbiology laboratory results can be obtained when: 	
	1.	The sample is kept on ice while in transit.
	1.	Appropriate aseptic technique is used during specimen collection
	1.	The specimen is delayed in transit to the laboratory
	1.	The attending doctor asks a student to obtain the specimen.
20.	When interpreting microbiology culture results: 
	1.	All cultured pathogens should be treated with appropriate antibiotics 
	1.	The possibility of culture contamination is very small
	1.	The pathogen cultured should be interpreted in the context of the patient’s clinical picture 
	1.	The possibility of colonisation rather than infection is not worth considering.
