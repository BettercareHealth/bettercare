# Micro-organisms of relevance to infection prevention and control

## Objectives 

When you have completed this section you should be able to:

*	Understand the basic structure and physiology of micro-organisms
*	Know how micro-organisms are transmitted
*	Understand the basic host defences against micro-organisms
*	Describe different types of healthcare-associated infections
*	Know how to use laboratory services effectively
*	Know the basics of communicable disease control.

## Introduction

### 2-1 What are micro-organisms?

Micro-organisms are very small life forms that are not visible to the naked eye. They include bacteria, viruses, fungi and microscopic parasites. Micro-organisms are found everywhere (on our bodies, in food, in soil, water and plants).  Most micro-organisms are not harmful to humans and many actually colonise and protect us by preventing growth of pathogens. 

### 2-2 What are pathogens?

Pathogens are micro-organisms that can cause disease (infection) and are potentially harmful to humans. To cause disease, these pathogenic micro-organisms must first be passed on (transmitted) to a person and then overcome the body’s defence systems.

## Pathogenic micro-organisms

### 2-3 Which types of micro-organisms can cause disease?
*	Bacteria are single-celled organisms with a rigid cell wall that can survive outside the human body and can multiply on their own (replicate) without the help of the human “host” cell.
*	Fungi and moulds are made up of many cells, each with a rigid cell wall, which allows survival and replication outside of the human body.
*	Viruses are made up of genetic material (either DNA and/or RNA) and they cannot survive or multiply outside the living cells of their hosts.
*	Parasites include the groups helminths (worms and flukes) and protozoa (amoebas, ciliates, flagellates, and sporozoans). They can also survive and multiply outside of the human host.
*	Prions are tiny protein particles which can cause infections if introduced into the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). 

### 2-4 How can micro-organisms be seen? 

Micro-organisms are usually not visible to the naked eye:

*	Bacteria, fungi, moulds and parasites can be seen under a microscope which enlarges (magnifies) by 100–1000 times. Bacteria range in size from around 1 to 5 microns (micrometres).
*	Viruses are much smaller, ranging in size from 30 to 400 nanometres. Viruses can only be seen using an electron microscope, which magnifies the image by up to 10 million times.

## Basic anatomy and physiology of bacteria

### 2-5 What do bacteria look like under the microscope?

Most bacteria are easily recognisable because they have particular shapes, staining characteristics and follow particular grouping or clustering patterns. 

### 2-6 How can bacteria be classified by their shape?

The shape of the bacteria varies for different families, for example they can appear round (cocci), rod-like (bacilli), spiral (spirochetes) or curved (vibrios).

### 2-7 How can bacteria be classified by their staining pattern?

Bacteria can also be classified based on their staining pattern. The Gram stain is the most commonly used laboratory method to identify the staining pattern of bacteria.  A smear is made on a glass slide of a fluid, either directly from a clinical sample (e.g. pus) or from a culture of growing bacteria (in liquid broth or on solid agar plates). The slide is allowed to dry and then stained with violet (blue) dye, decolourised and then stained with pink dye. Those bacteria that keep the blue dye stain are called Gram positive and those that lose the blue dye (decolour) will appear pink and are referred to as Gram negative.  The staining of bacteria also allows identification by shape, such as round cocci or long bacilli, and grouping pattern.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-------------------+-----------------------|

### 2-8 How can bacteria be classified by their grouping patterns?

The grouping pattern that the bacteria take up when seen under the microscope after staining, can also help to identify the bacterial species. For example some bacteria (staphylococci) are clustered together (appearing like a bunch of grapes) and others occur in chains (streptococci, enterococci). Most of the gram-negative rods (bacilli) have no particular grouping pattern.

### 2-9 What do mycobacteria look like under the microscope?

Mycobacteria form a group of bacteria causing diseases like tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae). They have a thick waxy layer that prevents the Gram stains from penetrating. Therefore a different staining technique called the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain is used, which allows a red dye (carbol fuschin) to enter and stain the mycobacterial cells. Acid and alcohol are then applied to the slide which removes colour from all other bacteria, but not the mycobacteria (which is why they are sometimes referred to as acid and alcohol fast). 

### 2-10 How are bacteria grown (cultured) in the laboratory?

In microbiology laboratories, bacteria are grown on agar plates (essentially a jelly containing all the nutrients that bacteria need to grow). The laboratory can use other appearances (bacterial growth characteristics) on these agar plates to further identify the species. For example, colonies of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria growing on an agar plate have a characteristic golden yellow colour.

### 2-11 How can bacteria be classified by the need for oxygen or carbon dioxide?

Bacteria can also be classified by their growth requirements such as the need for oxygen or carbon dioxide. Bacteria can be classified as aerobic bacteria (oxygen dependent), anaerobic bacteria (can grow in the absence of oxygen) and facultative anaerobic bacteria (can grow in the presence or absence of oxygen).

### 2-12 What is the structure of bacteria? 

Bacteria are single-cell organisms that have all the structures needed for their survival and replication. All bacteria are surrounded by a rigid outer cell wall, which gives them their shape (Gram-positive bacteria have thicker cell walls than Gram-negative bacteria). The cell wall allows some substances in and out of bacteria through tiny channels (porins). Some bacteria have projections from the cell wall called pili and flagella. Pili help with bacterial attachment to host cells, while flagella allow bacteria to move. A thin membrane called the cytoplasmic membrane runs inside the cell wall and holds together all the cell contents. Important cell contents include the bacterial genetic material (DNA) and ribosomes (which act as factories producing more genetic material).

![Figure 2-2: The structure of bacteria](images/2-2.svg)

{:.figure-caption}

### 2-13 What is the pattern of bacterial growth?

Bacteria will grow best when they are in an environment that provides the correct combination of nutrients, temperature and humidity. The time taken to multiply (replicate) depends on the environmental conditions and bacterial species, but can be as fast as every 20 minutes. The growth cycle can be divided into four phases:

1.	Lag phase: there is no growth (numbers remain static)
2.	Log phase: there is a rapid increase in bacterial numbers
3.	Stationary phase: numbers are maintained but there is no further growth (as the nutrient supply is used up)
4.	Death: the number of bacteria starts to reduce.   
Fungi, viruses and parasites

### 2-14 What is the structure of fungi?

Fungi are made up of many cells with a thick cell wall. Most fungi multiply by forming long string-like filaments (known as hyphae), some produce fungal spores (a type of resting form that fungi take up under unfavourable conditions) and others (yeasts) grow by budding. Fungi can be commonly found in the environment and can also cause a variety of diseases in humans. Candida is the most commonly encountered fungal infection in healthcare settings. Fungal infections can be superficial (affecting the skin and subcutaneous tissue) or deep (affecting organs) or systemic, (spreading throughout the body). Deep and systemic fungal infections usually occur in hosts with weakened immune systems.

### 2-15 What is the structure of viruses?

Viruses can only survive within host (human, animal or plant) cells, usually cells of the immune system. Once inside the host cells, viruses are relatively protected from the host’s defence mechanisms and can use the host structures to replicate. The intracellular location of viruses makes it difficult to produce drugs that kill the virus without causing damage to the host cell. 

Viruses are categorised both by their genetic make-up (single- or double-stranded, RNA or DNA) and their shape. The virus’ shape (icosahedral, helical and complex) is determined by its nucleocapsid structure, which is a combination of viral nucleic acid and capsid (the outer shell). In some viruses the nucleocapsid is covered by an outer membrane (known as an envelope), whereas others are “naked” or non-enveloped. Viruses without an envelope are more difficult to destroy or remove by disinfection.

### 2-16 How are parasites classified?

Parasites include the sub-groups protozoa and helminths. Protozoal parasites are divided into four main types, grouped by their form (structure) and how they move (motility).

1.	Protozoa:
	*	Sporozoa: these parasites can only exist inside host cells (intracellular), e.g. malarial parasites
	*	Flagellates: move using tail-like projections (flagellae), e.g. *Giardia lamblia* (causes giardiasis)
	*	Amoebae: move using special rounded projections (pseudopods), e.g. *Entamoeba histolytica* (causes amoebiasis)
	*	Ciliates: move by beating many tiny hair-like projections on the surface of their cells, e.g. *Balantidium coli* (causes balantidiasis).
2.	Helminths:
	The helminths are divided into worms and flukes. There are many different types of worms that can cause human infestations, including:
	*	Round worms (*Ascaris lumbricoides*)
	*	Pin or thread worms (*Enterobius vermicularis*)
	*	Hook worms (*Necator americanus*, *Ankylostoma duodenale*). 

	These worms are spread mainly by ingestion (swallowing) of the eggs. Certain helminths can be spread by insects (so-called vector-borne helminths which can infect blood and/or human tissues), e.g. *Loa loa* (onchocerciasis) and *Wuchereria bancrofti* (elephantiasis). The sub-group of helminths, known as flukes, include the parasites that cause bilharzia (*Schistosoma haematobium*) and gastro-intestinal diseases (*Schistosoma mansoni* and *japonicum*). 

## Transmission of micro-organisms

### 2-17 How are micro-organisms transmitted?

There are five main routes by which micro-organisms can be spread (see table 2-2).

|------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|

#### Contact 

There is physical contact, which can be direct or indirect, between the host and the person or surface carrying the micro-organism. 

#### Respiratory 

The host breathes in micro-organisms which have been exhaled by an infectious person, in the form of respiratory droplets or aerosols.

#### Ingestion 

The host either eats or drinks food or water that is contaminated by the micro-organism or touches a surface or person contaminated with faeces containing the micro-organism and then transfers the micro-organism into their mouth.

#### Inoculation 

Micro-organisms can be introduced to the body through trauma, injections, surgical procedures or through the bite of an insect or vector carrying the micro-organism. 

#### Transplacental

Micro-organisms circulating in the mother’s blood can cross the placenta during pregnancy causing infection in the fetus.

> Contact transmission is the MAIN route of infection transmission in healthcare facilities.

### 2-18 What is the chain of infection?

For infection to develop the following are needed: 

1.	An infectious agent (the disease-causing or pathogenic micro-organism)
2.	A susceptible host (a human with poor immune defences against the micro-organisms)
3.	The right environment (the ideal conditions under which infection can be spread).

The sequence of infection transmission is sometimes called the “chain of infection”. It is the step-wise manner in which a micro-organism can be transmitted to a susceptible host.

The following steps are required to spread an infectious agent or micro-organism (see figure 2-4):

#### 1.	It leaves its reservoir. 

A reservoir is the environment where the micro-organism is usually found, e.g. *Staphylococcus aureus* is commonly found in the nose; *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (TB) is commonly found in the lungs.

#### 2.	It leaves through a portal of exit.  

For example TB bacilli are coughed up from the lungs (respiratory tract) into the air.

#### 3.	It is transmitted by a route of infection.

For example, TB remains suspended in the air as aerosols (tiny particles containing the TB bacilli).

#### 4.	It gets into another person through a portal of entry. 

For example, TB bacilli suspended in the air may be breathed into the lungs of a person in the same room as the 
TB patient.

![Figure 2-4: The chain of infection](images/2-4.svg)

Figure 2-4: The chain of infection
{:.figure-caption}

### 2-19 How do micro-organisms enter the human body?

There are two main ways in which micro-organisms are acquired and can cause disease:

*	Exogenous acquisition: micro-organisms acquired from outside sources
*	Endogenous acquisition: micro-organisms acquired from the host’s own collection of micro-organisms (known as flora).

It is important to know how an infection was acquired in order to prevent its spread to other susceptible people (hosts).

### 2-20 What is colonisation?

Once a micro-organism has been acquired, it must compete with the host’s local flora and withstand any host defences. Pathogenic micro-organisms that become established and persist on, or in, the host, are said to have colonised the host. Colonisation does not always result in infection or invasive disease in the host, but can 
be a potential source for transmitting the micro-organisms to other susceptible hosts. 

> Colonisation does not always result in infection, but can potentially transmit micro-organisms to other susceptible hosts.

### 2-21 How do micro-organisms cause disease?

To progress from colonisation to infection, a micro-organism must invade or penetrate through the host tissues and defences. Micro-organisms have a selection of “virulence factors” which are mechanisms developed to overcome the body’s defences. Some pathogens also have special attachment mechanisms that allow them to find and enter specific host cells that will allow for survival and multiplication of the micro-organism.

Pathogenic micro-organisms can cause disease symptoms and signs by the following mechanisms:

*	Changing the function of the target tissue or organ, e.g. gut pathogens causing diarrhoea by increasing intestinal contractions
*	Releasing toxins (harmful chemicals) that damage the host’s organs or tissues and impair the normal function of cells, e.g toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 released by Staphylococcus aureus or  Streptococcus pyogenes causing rash, fever and circulatory collapse
*	Bulk effect, e.g. intestinal obstruction caused by worm infestation.

Sometimes the symptoms or signs of disease are caused by the host’s own immune response to infection that is trying to remove the pathogen from the body, e.g. fever or a runny nose from the common cold (rhinovirus).

## Defences against infection

### 2-22 What is the relationship between the invading micro-organism and the host?

Micro-organisms can be acquired (endogenously or exogenously), can become established (colonisation) and then may progress to infection (under favourable conditions) producing symptoms and signs of disease. The host has several ways of preventing micro-organism invasion in the first place or containing and/or destroying the micro-organisms once invasion has occurred. In hosts that have compromised natural defences or weakened immune systems (immune-compromise), progression from colonisation to infection is more likely. Immuno-competent hosts (with intact natural defences and immune systems), are able to overcome most minor invasions.

### 2-23 What are the host’s natural defences?

The host has three main defence mechanisms (see table 2-3), namely:

*	Physical barriers: intact skin, mucous membranes, respiratory tract lining and normal flora 
*	Innate (or inborn) immunity: complement and white blood cells
*	Acquired (or adaptive) immunity: B- and T-lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).

| PHYSICAL BARRIERS | Intact skin                          | When skin is damaged it is easier for pathogens to invade, e.g. burn wounds, drips                                                          |  |  |  |

### 2-24 What are normal flora?

Normal flora (sometimes called commensals) are micro-organisms that live on and in the human body (colonise) without causing infection. Normal flora are mostly bacteria, although fungi and protozoa are also included. The number of bacterial flora living on the body actually outnumber the total of all the cells in the human body! Normal flora are found on the skin, in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genital tracts. However, normal flora micro-organisms can cause infections if:

*	They invade a body space where they do not belong (e.g. E. coli in the bladder causing urinary tract infection)
*	They overgrow (e.g. normal bacterial flora can be destroyed by broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can lead to fungal overgrowth causing oral or vaginal thrush/candidiasis). This is called “opportunistic” infection, where a normal flora organism can act as a pathogen under circumstances where the host’s defences are weakened for some reason. 

> Normal flora are micro-organisms that live on and in the human body without causing infection.

### 2-25 What is the difference between resident and transient flora?

*	Resident flora, such as coagulase negative Staphylococci and Diphtheroids, are the commensal micro-organisms that are normally found on and in the human body (semi-permanently unless altered by antibiotic use). 
*	Transient flora, such as methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* and *E. coli*, are micro-organisms that are transferred onto the human host by contact with a contaminated person or object. They usually remain on the skin for short periods of time and are easily removed by washing and drying the area. Transient flora can, however, cause healthcare-associated infections, highlighting the important role of hand hygiene in reducing transfer of pathogens. Over time, transient flora, can become well established at a site (colonisation) and are then considered to be part of a person’s resident flora, e.g. healthcare workers who over time have become nasally colonised with methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA). 

### 2-26 How do normal flora protect us against infection?

Normal flora reduce the ability of pathogenic micro-organisms to colonise and multiply in the host by competing for space and nutrients. They can also produce chemical compounds (bacteriocidins) which kill other bacteria or make it difficult for other bacteria to grow by making the environment more acidic (lowering the pH). Normal gut and vaginal flora play a major role in preventing colonisation by pathogens.

> Normal flora protect the human host by reducing pathogens’ ability to colonise and multiply. 

## Healthcare-associated infections (HAI)

### 2-27 Why are infections acquired in healthcare facilities?

There are many factors that increase the risk of acquiring an infection in a healthcare setting (see table below).

*	Many sick individuals are nursed together in a confined space.
*	Medical equipment, facilities and healthcare staff are often shared.
*	Antibiotic use is common (reducing levels of protective normal flora and causing resistance in pathogens).
*	Medical and surgical procedures may disrupt many natural defence mechanisms.
*	In-dwelling devices can introduce pathogenic micro-organisms into the body.
*	Staff shortages or lack of appropriate infrastructure (washbasins, cough rooms, isolation rooms) can lead to poor IPC practice that increases the risk of HAI.

The table below demonstrates in greater detail the many factors that increase the likelihood of HAI occurring.

### 2-28 What are the main types of infections transmitted in healthcare facilities?  

The spectrum of HAI includes any infection that develops 48 hours or more after hospitalisation.

HAI include site-specific infections, e.g. bloodstream, surgical site, skin and soft tissue, urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections. HAI can also occur related to medical devices (so-called device-associated infections), e.g. central-line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), ventilator-associated events (VAE) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI).

> Types of healthcare-associated infections include site-specific infections and device-associated infections.

### 2-29 What are the main types of healthcare-associated pathogens?  

The type of healthcare-associated pathogens (and their antibiotic susceptibility profile) will vary for each healthcare facility and will change over time. New pathogens can be introduced to a facility (e.g. with outbreaks) and will become more difficult to remove the longer they remain in the environment or on colonised patients or staff. Some facilities use a laboratory surveillance system for HAI, based on designated “alert organisms”. In such cases, a facility decides, based on the burden of HAI, which infection-associated organisms to monitor for and to investigate clinically when they are isolated. Typical examples of alert organisms include: methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus*; *Acinetobacter baumanni*; and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.  

### 2-30 How can we prevent healthcare-associated infections?

The risk of transmitting infections in healthcare settings can be reduced by applying interventions and changing staff behaviour. IPC interventions to reduce the risk of micro-organism transmission include: standard precautions and transmission-based precautions.

### 2-31 What are standard precautions? 

Standard precautions (previously called universal precautions) reduce the chance of infection transmission from both known and unknown (unrecognised) sources of infection. These precautions should be applied to all patients in all circumstances, whether or not they are known to pose an infection risk. Examples of standard precautions are safe injection practices, proper hand hygiene and use of appropriate personal protective equipment when exposed to blood and body fluids. 

> Standard precautions should be applied to all patients in all circumstances, whether or not they are known to pose an infection risk.

### 2-32 What are transmission-based precautions?

Transmission-based precautions (TBP) are interventions put in place to reduce the chance of infection transmission for particular pathogens, e.g. airborne precautions for TB. Remember that TBP are always applied in addition to standard precautions. Bear in mind too that many pathogens have more than one route of transmission, e.g varicella (chickenpox) will need both airborne and contact precautions enacted. 

## The role of the laboratory 

### 2-33 What is the role of the laboratory in infection prevention and control?

A good working relationship between IPC and microbiology departments can contribute to better awareness of infection risks and improved IPC practices. In many settings accessing laboratory results is difficult, either because the laboratory is located far away or has insufficient staff to interact directly with clinical services. In such settings, the role of the IPC practitioner is critical to guide clinicians on how to contain potentially transmissible infections and to assist with outbreak investigation. A close relationship with the laboratory will help to gain access to urgent results with implications for management of patients (e.g. where isolation and/or transmission-based precautions are required).

### 2-34 How can infection transmission to laboratory workers be prevented?

Laboratory workers are at risk of acquiring infection through exposure to blood, body fluids, splashes and aerosols. Planning of laboratory design, safety features, work-flow and specimen handling techniques is essential to reduce this risk. In addition, laboratory workers should be fully immunised.

### 2-35 How can meaningful microbiology results be obtained?

When using a microbiology service, it is important to remember that the quality of the result obtained is often directly influenced by how well the sample is taken and transported to the laboratory. The following basic tips will improve the outcome of your test:

*	Label the request form in full with the patient’s details, the submitting clinician’s contact details, the ward or facility submitting the sample
*	A clear indication of which tests are required
*	A brief clinical history with (suspected) diagnosis; mention recent antibiotic therapy
*	Obtain your sample using best practice techniques (e.g. aseptic technique for blood cultures; sample from the urine sampling port of urine bags)
*	Ensure that you use the appropriate (leak-proof, unexpired) containers or tubes for the requested test
*	Place the sample and request form in a clear leak-proof bag (preferably within separate pockets)
*	Ensure the sample is delivered rapidly to the laboratory (some samples may require refrigeration).

> The quality of the microbiology result obtained is often directly influenced by how well the sample is taken and transported to the laboratory.

### 2-36 Using and interpreting microbiology results

Decisions regarding antibiotic treatment should be made keeping in mind the clinical picture – microbiology results should be considered only as a guide to treatment. Antibiotics are usually started as a “best guess” (empirical therapy) and then later modified depending on clinical response (improvement or deterioration) and taking into account laboratory findings. 

Microbiology results are especially helpful in antibiotic stewardship, which aims to reduce excessive or inappropriate use of antibiotics. For example, where no organisms have been isolated (or a viral infection is proven) and the patient is improving, antibiotics may often be safely discontinued. If a pathogen is identified, the antibiotic choice can be targeted (matched) to the particular pathogen isolated.  

Remember that microbiology results (especially where samples have not been properly obtained) may reflect contamination with skin flora or pathogenic organisms that are only colonising the site, but not causing the infection.  

## Control of communicable diseases

### 2-37 How is infection prevention and control involved in managing communicable disease? 

Communicable diseases are illnesses transmitted by a pathogenic micro-organism from an infected person, animal, or reservoir to a susceptible host. IPC teams deal with patients hospitalised with communicable (infectious) diseases, as well as managing IPC practices in the community. Education of community-based healthcare workers, patients and caregivers in IPC is important in preventing spread of communicable disease and containing outbreaks.

### 2-38 What are the main routes of transmission of communicable disease?

Three main routes of transmission are recognised:

*	Oro-faecal route: food or water contaminated with harmful micro-organisms is ingested, e.g. cholera-contaminated water or *Staphylococcus aureus*-contaminated food.
*	Inoculation route: involves introduction of infected blood or body fluids through medical devices (e.g. needles transmitting HIV, hepatitis B and C) or via vectors (insect “carriers”, e.g. malaria in mosquitos; Congo virus in ticks).
*	Respiratory route: where pathogens are transmitted via the air to a susceptible person.
In addition to these major routes, sexual disease transmission (e.g. HIV, syphilis) and transplacental (in utero) disease transmission (e.g. HIV, rubella) should also be considered.

### 2-39 What public health measures are needed to manage communicable disease?

Several general public health measures can be used to reduce the occurrence of communicable disease or to contain communicable disease in an outbreak situation:

*	Improving the quality of drinking water: through boiling or chemical disinfection with chlorine at 0.5 parts per million
*	Providing adequate sanitation or safe disposal of human faeces
*	Ensuring meticulous hand hygiene (especially in the preparation of food)
*	Improving a population’s resistance to infection by promoting better nutrition and uptake of immunisation
*	Control of vectors (e.g. indoor residual spraying for eradication of malaria-carrying mosquitos)
*	Use of education and awareness campaigns for communities
*	Interrupting transmission of communicable disease by treating and isolating infected persons (e.g. TB case-finding and implementing basic IPC principles to reduce risk of household transmission).

## Case study 1

A nine-month-old baby with a congenital heart defect is admitted to a paediatric ward in heart failure. He is placed in a cot next to a child recovering from adenovirus pneumonia. Four days later the baby with the heart defect develops breathing difficulty and requires admission to the intensive care unit. A tracheal aspirate isolates an adenovirus. Blood cultures show no growth.

### 1. How did the nine-month-old baby acquire the adenovirus infection?

Adenovirus is transmitted by the respiratory route (droplet infection). Respiratory droplets containing the virus can be inhaled or introduced to mucous membranes by direct or indirect contact (e.g. touching an adenovirus-contaminated surface and then placing fingers in the mouth).

### 2. Who is at risk of acquiring this infection?

Any person without previous immunity (antibodies) to adenovirus can become infected (including other patients, staff, parents and visitors).

### 3. How could transmission of this viral infection have been prevented?

The original patient who was known to be recovering from adenovirus pneumonia should have been isolated and placed under droplet precautions. The importance of hand hygiene should have been emphasised to the staff caring for these patients. Knowledge of duration of infectiousness of certain organisms is helpful.

## Case study 2

A 25-year-old man who has recently returned from Zimbabwe presents to his local clinic with a short history of profuse, watery diarrhoea and severe dehydration. He lives in a shack with no access to running water or toilet facilities. He is referred to hospital for intravenous rehydration. Over the following week, several more adults and children from the same informal settlement present to the local clinic with watery diarrhoea and dehydration. Stool specimens confirm that the cause of this diarrhoeal outbreak is *Vibrio cholera*. 

### 1. What is the route of transmission for this gastrointestinal pathogen?

*Vibrio cholera* is transmitted by the faeco-oral route through direct or indirect contact with contaminated water or an infected person’s body fluids (stool or vomitus). 

### 2. How will you prevent transmission of this diarrhoeal disease in hospital?

Contact precautions should be implemented, ideally in a single room with en suite toilet facilities. If there are many affected patients, those with diarrhoeal disease (suspected to be cholera) could be nursed together (cohorted) in one room. Ensure easy access to personal protective equipment (gloves, aprons) for staff caring for these patients. Make sure linen and waste from these patients are handled as potentially infectious. 

### 3. How will you prevent transmission of this diarrhoeal disease in the community?

A clean water source will have to be supplied (if the water is cholera-contaminated) or the community must be shown how to safely decontaminate water by boiling or chlorination. Community members with gastrointestinal symptoms should be sent to a healthcare facility for management. Education regarding the importance of hand hygiene and clean water sources should be provided in all local languages. 

## Case study 3

A 56-year-old woman is admitted to hospital with 60% burn wounds to her body from a shack fire. She requires admission to ICU for ventilation and has a central line and urinary catheter inserted.

Her burn wounds have become infected with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Acinetobacter baumanni*. She has had multiple courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The microbiology laboratory calls you to inform IPC that she has cultured a very antibiotic-resistant *Klebsiella pneumoniae* (a carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) from her last urine sample.

### 1. How will you establish if this organism is colonising or infecting this patient’s urinary tract? 

You will need to collect additional clinical and laboratory information on this patient. Review the clinical notes and speak to the attending doctor to establish if the patient has any symptoms and signs of a urinary tract infection. Check the urinalysis report for the presence of white cells (leucocytes) in the urine. 

### 2. When considering infection transmission, does it matter if this organism represents colonisation or infection? 

No, the risk of transmitting this highly resistant organism is just as great if the patient is colonised. The Burns Unit staff should be educated as to the potential for transmitting this organism to other patients. 

### 3. How would you handle this situation from an IPC point of view?

The patient should be placed under contact precautions, and should ideally be put in a single room with en suite toilet facilities. Ensure easy access to personal protective equipment (PPE) (gloves, aprons) for staff.  Try to provide dedicated equipment for this patient (to avoid the chance of carrying across this resistant bacteria to other patients). The Burns Unit staff should be educated as to the potential for transmitting this organism to other patients and the importance of excellent hand hygiene practice. 

## Case study 4

A severely ill eight-year-old boy is admitted to your casualty with a one day history of fever, exhaustion and muscle aches. He is noted to have extensive bruising. The doctor on call thinks that meningococcal septicaemia is the likely diagnosis.

### 1. How should this patient be managed from an IPC perspective?

The boy should be managed in isolation (away from other patients and visitors). The doctors and nurses caring for him should use contact and droplet precautions, since meningococcus can be spread through both these routes. 

### 2. What public health measures should be in place?

According to national policy, this is a telephonically notifiable disease, which must be reported to the local health authority within 24 hours of presentation to hospital. The local health authority usually co-ordinates the investigation of community and household contacts, and provides antibiotic prophylaxis to close contacts.

### 3. How soon can the patient be de-isolated (removed from the single room)?

After 24 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy, the patient can be de-isolated. It is very important to know (or to know where to find out about) the duration of contagiousness (infection risk) for different pathogens. This allows you (as an IPC practitioner) to make informed decisions on how long to recommend isolation of infectious patients. 

## Case study 5

A 26-year-old lady undergoes an emergency Caesarean section. Five days later her surgical wound looks infected and a wound swab grows a methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA).

### 1. Is this a community acquired infection or a healthcare-associated infection?

Since this is a site-specific infection (surgical site) caused by an “alert pathogen” (MRSA), which developed more than 48 hours after admission, it is classified as a healthcare-associated infection.

### 2. What is the most likely route of infection in this case?

The most likely route or mode of infection is contact transmission (through the hands of healthcare workers). An important risk factor favouring the pathogen’s entry is the disruption of skin by the surgical incision.

### 3. What steps are needed to contain this pathogen?

All healthcare workers caring for this patient should use contact precautions (gloves and aprons). If possible, the patient should be placed in single-room isolation. Strict compliance with hand hygiene protocols should be enforced. 

## Case study 6

A 25-year-old recently married lady attends an outpatient clinic complaining of lower abdominal pain and painful micturition (passing of urine). The treating doctor requests urinalysis and a urine sample for laboratory microscopy and culture.  Clear instructions are given to the patient regarding the sterile collection of a urine sample (to avoid contamination from the skin around the urethra). 

### 1. Why is it important to give the patient instructions on urine collection methods?

The quality of the microbiology results will depend on how well the sample is collected. The chance of contaminating the urine sample (with normal flora from the skin in the genital area) is high. If the sample becomes contaminated at collection, it may be difficult to distinguish between growth of contaminants (skin flora) or true pathogens. 

### 2. *Escherichia coli* is isolated from this patient’s urine culture. How was this infection acquired?

In this case, the patient developed the infection at home, so it is classified as a community-acquired infection. *E. coli* is a common cause of urinary tract infections and is usually considered an endogenous infection (acquired from the host’s own collection of micro-organisms, known as flora).
