# Test 1: Role and structure of infection prevention and control programmes

1.	Infection prevention and control:
	-	Aims to prevent infection transmission in the community only
	+	Is the duty of care of every healthcare worker
	-	Is the responsibility of the healthcare facility manager only
	-	Is the sole responsibility of the IPC practitioner. 
2.	Infection prevention and control programmes:
	+	Include activities, procedures and policies to reduce spread of infections
	-	Do not form part of quality management programmes 
	-	Aim to contain the spread of anti-microbial sensitive micro-organisms 
	-	Exist only in healthcare facilities.
3.	Infection prevention and control programmes are needed because: 
	-	Healthcare workers are lazy and negligent
	-	Less than 30% of infections are preventable 
	+	Sick people congregate in healthcare facilities with potential for micro-organisms to spread
	-	Healthcare-associated infections have minimal impact on healthcare costs. 
4.	Key activities of an infection prevention and control practitioner include: 
	+	Surveillance, outbreak investigation, training, audits and policy development
	-	Running the occupational health service 
	-	Providing assistance with the quality management programme 
	-	Working in the laboratory and the sterile services department.
5.	Regarding organisation of infection prevention and control management structures: 
	+	An IPC management structure operates at different levels of the healthcare system
	-	All IPC programmes should be run by the national department of health
	-	All IPC programmes should be run by individual facility’s IPC committees
	-	All IPC programmes should fall under the Quality Management directorate.
6.	Who is responsible for implementing infection prevention and control? 
	-	The healthcare facility manager
	-	The healthcare facility’s IPC committee
	-	The IPC practitioner
	+	All healthcare workers.
7.	Ideally, what human resources are needed to run an infection prevention and control programme? 
	+	An IPC team, consisting of an IPC doctor and IPC nurse practitioners
	-	One IPC nurse practitioner for every 500 beds 
	-	One IPC practitioner per facility, who also performs occupational health duties
	-	At least one IPC link nurse per ward or clinical area.
8.	The role of the infection prevention and control committee is to: 
	-	Fill in for the IPC practitioner when they are on leave
	+	Advise and assist with management of the IPC programme 
	-	Investigate outbreaks and make recommendations to facility management
	-	Replace the need for a full-time IPC practitioner post.
9.	Which categories of healthcare worker require training in infection prevention and control? 
	-	Clinical workers, e.g. nurses, doctors, physiotherapists
	-	Non-clinical workers, e.g. reception staff, porters, cleaners 
	-	Community-based workers, e.g. community treatment supporters 
	+	Any healthcare worker who comes into contact with patients and visitors.
10.	When should healthcare workers be trained in infection prevention and control? 
	-	At induction (pre-employment)
	-	At undergraduate or pre-service level
	+	At pre-service, induction and in-service training 
	-	Annually in-service.
11.	The purpose of an audit in infection prevention and control is:
	+	To compare observed practice with a pre-determined standard of care
	-	To establish to what extent suggestions have been implemented 
	-	To achieve continuous quality improvement in healthcare 
	-	To identify clinical areas that are performing better than others. 
12.	Before conducting an audit you need to: 
	-	Inform every staff member in the area being audited, even if management gives permission 
	+	Agree on the reference standard against which the clinical area will be compared
	-	Identify which clinical areas are underperforming 
	-	Assemble a team of assessors who do not need any prior experience in IPC audits.
13.	Policies should be updated or revised: 
	-	Once a year
	-	When a new head of department is appointed, according to their preferences
	+	When new evidence emerges, legislation is passed or clinical practices change 
	-	Whenever healthcare facility management decides the policy is outdated.
14.	Policies should be drafted by: 
	-	The IPC team alone
	-	The IPC committee or facility management 
	-	The national department of health and implemented at facility level 
	+	The IPC practitioner in consultation with all stakeholders.
15.	A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a: 
	+	Written explanation of how to perform a practical task
	-	Guideline on how to operate a piece of medical equipment 
	-	Tool to assist healthcare workers with low-risk procedures 
	-	Measure of how well a facility scores compared to a national standard of care.
16.	Reports are used in infection prevention and control to:
	-	Penalise clinical areas that do not comply with IPC best practice
	-	Increase managers’ awareness of IPC problems 
	-	Provide as much information as possible about the IPC programme activities
	+	Document findings and facts about a particular situation, service or practice.
17.	Infection prevention and control and occupational health services: 
	-	Have no common areas of responsibility
	+	Should work closely together to ensure the safety of patients, visitors and staff
	-	Work together only to prevent occupational TB and needlestick injuries 
	-	Cannot be staffed by a single IPC/OHS practitioner.
18.	Programmes where infection prevention and control and occupational health services should collaborate are: 
	+	Needlestick injury, occupational TB prevention and related training and policy development
	-	Workplace safety using risk assessments 
	-	Medical examinations of injured or diseased staff 
	-	Provision of first aid courses for staff. 
19.	A healthcare facility’s needlestick injury policy: 
	-	Should be updated every five years
	-	Does not need to be included in pre-employment (induction) training 
	+	Should be easily accessible and understandable to all staff
	-	Does not need approval by the facility management. 
20.	General procedures following a needlestick injury include: 
	-	Reporting the injury to a supervisor within one week of the incident
	-	Commencing post-exposure prophylaxis within 24 hours of the injury
	+	Establishing the HIV and hepatitis immune status of the injured staff and the source case 
	-	Encouraging the wound to bleed by sucking on the injured area.
