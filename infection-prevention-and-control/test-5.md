# Test 5: Infection control considerations for healthcare facility design

Please choose the ONE most correct answer to each question:

1.	The most important consideration when designing a new healthcare facility is: 
	1.	The budget available for the project
	1.	The disease profile of the local community
	1.	The community’s stated service needs
	1.	The existing facilities available in 
the area. 
2.	Infection control practitioners should be involved in healthcare facility design because:
	1.	They can advise on design elements to reduce healthcare-associated infection (HAI)
	1.	They will have to work in the facility once built
	1.	They know better than clinicians what is required for a new building
	1.	They are required by law in all countries to be involved in all building projects.
3.	Infection control practitioners should be involved in healthcare facility design: 
	1.	Just before the ward is opened to admit new patients
	1.	Just before the building or renovation work starts
	1.	After the approved plans have been received from the architect
	1.	When the ideas for the building or renovation are first being discussed. 
4.	Infection control practitioners should advise on the following aspects: 
	1.	Resuscitation and clinical equipment needed
	1.	The colour of the walls and floors
	1.	Isolation rooms, ventilation, layout and fittings
	1.	The admission criteria for patients to the new ward/area.
5.	Beds in the general wards should be separated by at least:
	1.	2.5 metres (centre of bed to centre of next bed)
	1.	3.0 metres (edge of bed to edge of next bed) 
	1.	3.5 metres (centre of bed to centre of next bed)
	1.	2.5 metres (edge of bed to edge of next bed).
6.	In general wards, at least one dedicated handwash basin should be provided:
	1.	For every bed
	1.	For every two beds
	1.	For every four beds
	1.	For every six beds.
7.	The common route/s for infection transmission in clinics include: 
	1.	Respiratory 
	1.	Respiratory and contact
	1.	Faeco-oral 
	1.	Innoculation.  
8.	The highest risk of infection in dental clinics is from: 
	1.	Blood-borne viruses
	1.	Bacteria
	1.	Gastro-intestinal viruses
	1.	Prions.
9.	Isolation rooms: 
	1.	Should make up at least 30% of all hospital beds
	1.	Should always be mechanically ventilated under positive pressure
	1.	Do not need en suite bathrooms
	1.	Function to separate infectious patients from susceptible patients. 
10.	Operating theatres:
	1.	Should be mechanically ventilated under negative pressure
	1.	Should be kept at temperatures between 24 and 28 °C
	1.	May routinely sterilize their own surgical equipment in the theatre
	1.	Should have well-demarcated “clean” and “sterile” zones.
11.	Intensive care units (ICU):
	1.	Do not require isolation rooms as the beds are far apart 
	1.	Should have a minimum of 2.5 metres space between beds
	1.	Require at least one handwash basin for every six ICU beds
	1.	Should regularly train their staff on hand hygiene and aseptic technique. 
12.	Accident and emergency units:
	1.	Do not require isolation rooms/bays
	1.	Should have sharps containers within easy reach of every bed/bay
	1.	Must have negative pressure ventilation
	1.	Are not high-risk areas for needlestick injuries.
13.	Patients in burns wards: 
	1.	Are not at particularly high risk of infection
	1.	Acquire infections mostly by respiratory transmission 
	1.	Acquire infections by contact with staff, equipment and the environment
	1.	Should all be placed under protective isolation.
14.	Neonatal wards require:
	1.	One isolation room for every 30 beds
	1.	Disease screening protocols for mothers admitted to kangaroo care units
	1.	Handwash basins next to every cot/incubator
	1.	Specialised environmental disinfection of all surfaces. 
15.	Milk preparation areas:
	1.	Are a high-risk area for microbial contamination of infant feeds
	1.	Can store milk in fridges together with medication and foodstuffs
	1.	Can prepare feeds up to 48 hours in advance
	1.	Can use low-level disinfection for babies’ bottles and teats. 
16.	With regard to expressed breastmilk (EBM):
	1.	The risk of HIV or hepatitis transmission through breastmilk is low
	1.	Mothers may express, label and store the EBM themselves
	1.	EBM should be stored at 4–6 °C and used within 24 hours
	1.	Pasteurisation is not needed for pooled EBM.
17.	Mortuary workers:  
	1.	Do not require personal protective equipment since corpses do not transmit infections
	1.	Are at risk of penetrating injuries, mucosal splashes and infection with respiratory pathogens
	1.	Are not required to change out of their personal clothing before coming on duty  
	1.	Are not required to shower before coming off duty.
18.	Ambulance staff:
	1.	Should try to establish any infection transmission hazards before transporting a patient
	1.	Should wear surgical masks when transporting patients with pulmonary TB
	1.	Should ask patients with pulmonary TB to wear N95 respirators when inside the ambulance
	1.	May use alcohol handrub to decontaminate hands covered in blood or mucus.
19.	Hospital kitchens: 
	1.	Staff require only routine pre-employment health checks
	1.	Require the same personal protective equipment as the clinical staff
	1.	May prepare raw and cooked food in the same area
	1.	Require an uninterrupted supply of hot and cold water. 
20.	Support services staff:
	1.	Are at lower risk for pathogen exposure than clinical staff
	1.	Should receive pre-employment hepatitis B immunisation
	1.	Are not required to wear personal protective equipment
	1.	Are not required to undergo training in infection prevention and control.
