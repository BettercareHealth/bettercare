# Test 5: Infection control considerations for healthcare facility design

1.	The most important consideration when designing a new healthcare facility is: 
	-	The budget available for the project
	+	The disease profile of the local community
	-	The community’s stated service needs
	-	The existing facilities available in the area. 
2.	Infection control practitioners should be involved in healthcare facility design because:
	+	They can advise on design elements to reduce healthcare-associated infection (HAI)
	-	They will have to work in the facility once built
	-	They know better than clinicians what is required for a new building
	-	They are required by law in all countries to be involved in all building projects.
3.	Infection control practitioners should be involved in healthcare facility design: 
	-	Just before the ward is opened to admit new patients
	-	Just before the building or renovation work starts
	-	After the approved plans have been received from the architect
	+	When the ideas for the building or renovation are first being discussed. 
4.	Infection control practitioners should advise on the following aspects: 
	-	Resuscitation and clinical equipment needed
	-	The colour of the walls and floors
	+	Isolation rooms, ventilation, layout and fittings
	-	The admission criteria for patients to the new ward/area.
5.	Beds in the general wards should be separated by at least:
	+	2.5 metres (centre of bed to centre of next bed)
	-	3.0 metres (edge of bed to edge of next bed) 
	-	3.5 metres (centre of bed to centre of next bed)
	-	2.5 metres (edge of bed to edge of next bed).
6.	In general wards, at least one dedicated handwash basin should be provided:
	-	For every bed
	-	For every two beds
	-	For every four beds
	+	For every six beds.
7.	The common route/s for infection transmission in clinics include: 
	-	Respiratory 
	+	Respiratory and contact
	-	Faeco-oral 
	-	Inoculation.  
8.	The highest risk of infection in dental clinics is from: 
	+	Blood-borne viruses
	-	Bacteria
	-	Gastro-intestinal viruses
	-	Prions.
9.	Isolation rooms: 
	-	Should make up at least 30% of all hospital beds
	-	Should always be mechanically ventilated under positive pressure
	-	Do not need en suite bathrooms
	+	Function to separate infectious patients from susceptible patients. 
10.	Operating theatres:
	-	Should be mechanically ventilated under negative pressure
	-	Should be kept at temperatures between 24 and 28 °C
	-	May routinely sterilize their own surgical equipment in the theatre
	+	Should have well-demarcated ‘clean’ and ‘sterile’ zones.
11.	Intensive care units (ICU):
	-	Do not require isolation rooms as the beds are far apart 
	-	Should have a minimum of 2.5 metres space between beds
	-	Require at least one handwash basin for every six ICU beds
	+	Should regularly train their staff on hand hygiene and aseptic technique. 
12.	Accident and emergency units:
	-	Do not require isolation rooms/bays
	+	Should have sharps containers within easy reach of every bed/bay
	-	Must have negative pressure ventilation
	-	Are not high-risk areas for needlestick injuries.
13.	Patients in burns wards: 
	-	Are not at particularly high risk of infection
	-	Acquire infections mostly by respiratory transmission 
	+	Acquire infections by contact with staff, equipment and the environment
	-	Should all be placed under protective isolation.
14.	Neonatal wards require:
	-	One isolation room for every 30 beds
	+	Disease screening protocols for mothers admitted to kangaroo care units
	-	Handwash basins next to every cot/incubator
	-	Specialised environmental disinfection of all surfaces. 
15.	Milk preparation areas:
	+	Are a high-risk area for microbial contamination of infant feeds
	-	Can store milk in fridges together with medication and foodstuffs
	-	Can prepare feeds up to 48 hours in advance
	-	Can use low-level disinfection for babies’ bottles and teats. 
16.	With regard to expressed breastmilk (EBM):
	-	The risk of HIV or hepatitis transmission through breastmilk is low
	-	Mothers may express, label and store the EBM themselves
	+	EBM should be stored at 4–6 °C and used within 24 hours
	-	Pasteurisation is not needed for pooled EBM.
17.	Mortuary workers:  
	-	Do not require personal protective equipment since corpses do not transmit infections
	+	Are at risk of penetrating injuries, mucosal splashes and infection with respiratory pathogens
	-	Are not required to change out of their personal clothing before coming on duty  
	-	Are not required to shower before coming off duty.
18.	Ambulance staff:
	+	Should try to establish any infection transmission hazards before transporting a patient
	-	Should wear surgical masks when transporting patients with pulmonary TB
	-	Should ask patients with pulmonary TB to wear N95 respirators when inside the ambulance
	-	May use alcohol handrub to decontaminate hands covered in blood or mucus.
19.	Hospital kitchens: 
	-	Staff require only routine pre-employment health checks
	-	Require the same personal protective equipment as the clinical staff
	-	May prepare raw and cooked food in the same area
	+	Require an uninterrupted supply of hot and cold water. 
20.	Support services staff:
	-	Are at lower risk for pathogen exposure than clinical staff
	+	Should receive pre-employment hepatitis B immunisation
	-	Are not required to wear personal protective equipment
	-	Are not required to undergo training in infection prevention and control.
