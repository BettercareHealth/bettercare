# Acknowledgements

The Fetal Heart Rate Handbook was written by the members of Power-free Education and Technology (PET), and edited by Professor David Woods. PET is a not-for-profit organisation in South Africa which aims to improve healthcare in under resourced countries through the development of appropriate power-independent medical devices together with associated education material. Most of the content of the handbook was taken from the Maternal Care and Intrapartum Care course books of the Perinatal Education Programme which can be viewed on the Bettercare website (www.bettercare.co.za). 

PET wishes to thank Professors Gerhard Theron, Bob Pattinson and Justus Hofmeyr who reviewed the handbook. Their expertise in fetal monitoring and wise advice is greatly appreciated. 

The Fetal Heart Rate Handbook was specifically written to accompany the Philips wind-up fetal heart rate monitor which was developed in partnership with PET.
