# Test 3: HIV during labour and delivery

Please choose the ONE most correct answer to each question:

1.	What is the chance of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV during labour and vaginal delivery if the woman is not receiving antiretroviral prophylaxis?
	1.	5%
	1.	15%
	1.	25%
	1.	50%
2.	Can HIV infection be diagnosed for the first time during labour?
	1.	Yes, by using a rapid screening test
	1.	Only if the labour lasts longer than 12 hours as the test takes many hours to perform
	1.	Only if the woman has clinical signs of AIDS
	1.	No
3.	During labour, women who are HIV positive should be:
	1.	Isolated in a single ward and barrier nursed
	1.	Cared for with other women in the general labour ward
	1.	Cared for in a clinic only and not admitted to a hospital if complications develop
	1.	Always be cared for at home where they cannot infect other patients
4.	In women who are HIV positive, the membranes should:
	1.	Be ruptured as soon as possible to speed up the labour
	1.	Be ruptured when the cervix reaches 4 cm dilatation
	1.	Only be ruptured when the cervix is 8 cm dilated
	1.	Not be artificially ruptured unless there is a good clinical indication
5.	In women with HIV infection:
	1.	The risk of preterm labour is the same as in HIV-negative women
	1.	The risk of preterm labour is doubled
	1.	The risk of preterm labour is reduced
	1.	Preterm labour is rare
6.	The risk of vertical transmission is increased in:
	1.	Preterm labour
	1.	Post-term labour
	1.	Term labour
	1.	Rapid labours
7.	Does HIV infection in a well-nourished mother cause intra-uterine growth restriction?
	1.	Usually it does
	1.	Usually it does not
	1.	Only if the mother is receiving zidovudine (AZT)
	1.	Only if chorioamnionitis is present
8.	The following procedure may reduce the risk of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV, especially if ARV prophylaxis has not been used:
	1.	Elective Caesarean section
	1.	A Caesarean section while in labour
	1.	An episiotomy
	1.	Vacuum extraction
9.	Caesarean section in HIV-positive women:
	1.	Increases the risk of maternal wound sepsis
	1.	Decreases the risk of maternal pneumonia in the puerperium
	1.	Increases the risk of bacterial infection in the infant
	1.	Decreases the risk of hyaline membrane disease in the infant
10.	In HIV-positive women, an episiotomy should:
	1.	Be done routinely to shorten the second stage of labour
	1.	Should never be done because it does not heal
	1.	Should only be done if there is a good clinical reason as it may increase the risk of vertical transmission to the infant
	1.	Only be done by a doctor
11.	Which HIV-positive women are at greatest risk of transmitting the virus to their infant?
	1.	Women in the latent phase of the infection
	1.	Women who have clinical signs of advanced HIV disease
	1.	Women who have short labours
	1.	Women who have not transmitted HIV to their previous children
12.	The following procedure may reduce the risk of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV during labour and delivery by 50% if an unbooked mother is diagnosed to be HIV positive when admitted in labour:
	1.	Giving the infant intramuscular vitamin K after delivery
	1.	Active management of the third stage of labour
	1.	Speed up labour with an oxytocin infusion
	1.	Giving the mother a single dose of NVP
13.	Vaginal wiping with chlorhexidine during labour in HIV-positive women may:
	1.	Reduce the risk of HIV transmission
	1.	May reduce the risk of puerperal sepsis and neonatal sepsis
	1.	Cause inflammation and increase the risk of HIV transmission
	1.	Reduce the risk of meconium aspiration
14.	After delivering the infant of an HIV-positive woman:
	1.	The infantâ€™s mouth should be well suctioned.
	1.	The infant should not be fed for 12 hours.
	1.	The infant should be well dried.
	1.	The infant should not be given to the mother for at least six hours.
15.	During labour and delivery mothers on FDC should:
	1.	Receive a single dose of NVP
	1.	Continue with daily FDC
	1.	All ARV drugs should temporarily be stopped and only restarted after delivery
	1.	Receive 3 hourly AZT
16.	What drugs should be given to women at the same time or after delivery if they receive a single dose of nevirapine in labour?
	1.	AZT and 3TC
	1.	TDF and FTC (Truvada)
	1.	Nevirapine and AZT
	1.	Lopinavir and ritonavir 
17.	Which risk factor is associated with an increased risk of HIV transmission during labour even if ARV drugs are used correctly for prophylaxis or treatment?
	1.	Elective Caesarean section
	1.	Posterm delivery 
	1.	Male infant
	1.	A high viral load
18.	How can staff reduce the risk of becoming infected with HIV themselves during the management of labour?
	1.	They should not perform vaginal examinations.
	1.	They should not rupture the membranes.
	1.	They should wear gloves.
	1.	They should be immunised against HIV.
19.	How can staff reduce the risk of becoming infected themselves with HIV during Caesarean section or episiotomy repair?
	1.	Needles should always be held with forceps.
	1.	The patient must be washed with chlorhexidine.
	1.	Hands should be washed after the procedure is completed.
	1.	Needles must be hand held whenever possible.
20.	What form of family planning will reduce the risk of spreading HIV to a sexual partner?
	1.	Tubal ligation
	1.	Injectables, such as Depo-Provera
	1.	Male or female condoms
	1.	Oral contraceptives
