# Test 3: HIV during labour and delivery

1.	What is the chance of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV during labour and vaginal delivery if the woman is not receiving antiretroviral prophylaxis?
	-	5%
	+	15%
	-	25%
	-	50%
2.	Can HIV infection be diagnosed for the first time during labour?
	+	Yes, by using a rapid screening test
	-	Only if the labour lasts longer than 12 hours as the test takes many hours to perform
	-	Only if the woman has clinical signs of AIDS
	-	No
3.	During labour, women who are HIV positive should be:
	-	Isolated in a single ward and barrier nursed
	+	Cared for with other women in the general labour ward
	-	Cared for in a clinic only and not admitted to a hospital if complications develop
	-	Always be cared for at home where they cannot infect other patients
4.	In women who are HIV positive, the membranes should:
	-	Be ruptured as soon as possible to speed up the labour
	-	Be ruptured when the cervix reaches 4 cm dilatation
	-	Only be ruptured when the cervix is 8 cm dilated
	+	Not be artificially ruptured unless there is a good clinical indication
5.	In women with HIV infection:
	-	The risk of preterm labour is the same as in HIV-negative women
	+	The risk of preterm labour is doubled
	-	The risk of preterm labour is reduced
	-	Preterm labour is rare
6.	The risk of vertical transmission is increased in:
	+	Preterm labour
	-	Post-term labour
	-	Term labour
	-	Rapid labours
7.	Does HIV infection in a well-nourished mother cause intra-uterine growth restriction?
	-	Usually it does
	+	Usually it does not
	-	Only if the mother is receiving zidovudine (AZT)
	-	Only if chorioamnionitis is present
8.	The following procedure may reduce the risk of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV, especially if ARV prophylaxis has not been used:
	+	Elective Caesarean section
	-	A Caesarean section while in labour
	-	An episiotomy
	-	Vacuum extraction
9.	Caesarean section in HIV-positive women:
	+	Increases the risk of maternal wound sepsis
	-	Decreases the risk of maternal pneumonia in the puerperium
	-	Increases the risk of bacterial infection in the infant
	-	Decreases the risk of hyaline membrane disease in the infant
10.	In HIV-positive women, an episiotomy should:
	-	Be done routinely to shorten the second stage of labour
	-	Should never be done because it does not heal
	+	Should only be done if there is a good clinical reason as it may increase the risk of vertical transmission to the infant
	-	Only be done by a doctor
11.	Which HIV-positive women are at greatest risk of transmitting the virus to their infant?
	-	Women in the latent phase of the infection
	+	Women who have clinical signs of advanced HIV disease
	-	Women who have short labours
	-	Women who have not transmitted HIV to their previous children
12.	The following procedure may reduce the risk of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV during labour and delivery by 50% if an unbooked mother is diagnosed to be HIV positive when admitted in labour:
	-	Giving the infant intramuscular vitamin K after delivery
	-	Active management of the third stage of labour
	-	Speed up labour with an oxytocin infusion
	+	Giving the mother a single dose of NVP
13.	Vaginal wiping with chlorhexidine during labour in HIV-positive women may:
	-	Reduce the risk of HIV transmission
	+	May reduce the risk of puerperal sepsis and neonatal sepsis
	-	Cause inflammation and increase the risk of HIV transmission
	-	Reduce the risk of meconium aspiration
14.	After delivering the infant of an HIV-positive woman:
	-	The infantâ€™s mouth should be well suctioned.
	-	The infant should not be fed for 12 hours.
	+	The infant should be well dried.
	-	The infant should not be given to the mother for at least six hours.
15.	During labour and delivery mothers on FDC should:
	-	Receive a single dose of NVP
	+	Continue with daily FDC
	-	All ARV drugs should temporarily be stopped and only restarted after delivery
	-	Receive 3 hourly AZT
16.	What drugs should be given to women at the same time or after delivery if they receive a single dose of nevirapine in labour?
	-	AZT and 3TC
	+	TDF and FTC (Truvada)
	-	Nevirapine and AZT
	-	Lopinavir and ritonavir 
17.	Which risk factor is associated with an increased risk of HIV transmission during labour even if ARV drugs are used correctly for prophylaxis or treatment?
	-	Elective Caesarean section
	-	Postterm delivery 
	-	Male infant
	+	A high viral load
18.	How can staff reduce the risk of becoming infected with HIV themselves during the management of labour?
	-	They should not perform vaginal examinations.
	-	They should not rupture the membranes.
	+	They should wear gloves.
	-	They should be immunised against HIV.
19.	How can staff reduce the risk of becoming infected themselves with HIV during Caesarean section or episiotomy repair?
	+	Needles should always be held with forceps.
	-	The patient must be washed with chlorhexidine.
	-	Hands should be washed after the procedure is completed.
	-	Needles must be hand held whenever possible.
20.	What form of family planning will reduce the risk of spreading HIV to a sexual partner?
	-	Tubal ligation
	-	Injectables, such as Depo-Provera
	+	Male or female condoms
	-	Oral contraceptives
