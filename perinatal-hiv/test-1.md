	+	A serious illness caused by a virus
	-	A fatal disease whose cause is unknown
	-	A common cause of abnormal sexual behaviour
	-	An acute bacterial illness transmitted by sexual intercourse
3.	You can become infected with HIV by:
	-	Sharing a cup or plate
	-	Social kissing
	+	Unprotected sexual intercourse
	-	Donating blood
4.	Which body secretions may contain large amounts of HIV?

	-	Stool
	+	Blood
	-	Saliva
5.	Which blood tests are usually used to screen adults for HIV infection?
	-	VDRL or RPR
	+	ELISA or rapid test
	-	PCR or p24 antigen
	-	TPHA or FTA
6.	Common features of the acute illness following HIV infection (acute seroconversion illness) are:
	-	Blood and protein in the urine
	-	Vaginal or urethral discharge
	-	Anaemia and jaundice
	+	Sore throat and rash
7.	Usually the latent phase between the time of HIV infection and developing AIDS in adults is:
	-	Two to four weeks
	-	Six to 12 months
	-	One to five years
	+	Five to 15 years
8.	What are the most common signs of symptomatic HIV infection in adults?
	+	Weight loss and chronic diarrhoea
	-	Oedema and heart failure
	-	Cyanosis and wheezing
	-	Jaundice and abdominal distension
9.	What is an important opportunistic infection in AIDS?
	-	Syphilis
	+	Pneumocystis
	-	Measles
	-	Influenza
10.	AIDS can be cured?
	-	Always
	-	Often
	-	Sometimes
	+	Never
11.	What other disease can increase the risk of becoming infected with HIV?
	-	Tuberculosis
	-	Kaposi’s sarcoma
	+	Syphilis
	-	Influenza
12.	HIV is infectious:
	-	Only during the first few weeks after infection
	-	During the latent phase when the patient feels well
	-	Only when the signs of AIDS appear
	+	At any time after infection
13.	How does HIV damage the immune system?
	+	By destroying CD4 lymphocytes
	-	By reducing the number of CD8 lymphocytes
	-	By lowering the levels of antibody
	-	By interfering with the function of the polymorphs
14.	What type of drugs are nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV)?
	-	Antibiotics
	-	Protease inhibitors
	+	Non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors
	-	Nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors
15.	What is a common minor side effect of zidovudine (AZT)?
	-	Tinnitus (ringing sound in the ears)
	-	Sore throat
	+	Nausea and vomiting
	-	Rash
16.	What drug is commonly used to prevent an opportunistic infection?
	-	Penicillin
	+	Co-trimoxazole (Septran, Bactrim, Purbac)
	-	Nystatin (mycostatin)
	-	Streptomycin
17.	What is the management of a patient with AIDS?
	-	Management does not alter the course of the disease and, therefore, is not recommended.
	-	These patients should not be treated as it is too expensive.
	+	Management with ARV drugs can make a big difference to the quality of the patient’s life.
	-	HIV patients should be sent home to die quickly as treatment only prolongs their suffering.
18.	How can healthcare workers reduce the risk of HIV infection?
	-	By refusing to care for AIDS patients
	-	By washing their hands after touching patients with HIV infection
	-	By wearing masks and gowns when caring for patients with HIV infection
	+	By adopting universal precautions
19.	What is the correct handling of sharps to avoid accidental injury?
	+	Use a sharps container
	-	Always resheath a needle after it has been used
	-	Always wipe a needle with alcohol after it has been used
	-	Only clear away the needle after the procedure has been completed
20.	What prophylaxis should be given to a healthcare worker after an accidental needle-stick injury when collecting blood from an HIV-positive patient?
	-	Penicillin should be given immediately
	+	Truvada and Aluvia should be started within two hours
	-	Hepatitis A vaccine should be given within 72 hours
	-	Co-trimoxazole
