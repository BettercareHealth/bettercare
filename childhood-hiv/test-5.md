# Test 5: Management of children with antiretroviral treatment

1.	At which clinical stage should antiretroviral treatment be started in children older than 5 years?
	*	Clinical stage 1
	*	Clinical stage 2
	*	Clinical stage 3 or 4
	*	Clinical stages alone cannot be used as treatment criteria.
2.	At what immunological stage should antiretroviral treatment be started in children older than 5 years?
	*	CD4 count on or below 350 cells/µl
	*	CD4 count on or below 500 cells/µl 
	*	Only the clinical stage and not the immunological stage is important in these children.
	*	All these HIV-infected children should receive antiretroviral treatment.
3.	Which one of the following is essential before starting antiretroviral treatment?
	*	The mother should have at least seven years schooling.
	*	There must be at least one responsible adult to help administer medication.
	*	The father should be employed.
	*	The parents should own their house.
4.	Where should antiretroviral treatment be started?
	*	Always in hospital
	*	At any regional hospital
	*	At any primary healthcare clinic
	*	Only at a clinic or hospital with staff trained in antiretroviral treatment
5.	What is ‘patient readiness’?
	*	The child should be well enough to take oral medication.
	*	The parents should be able to afford the drugs needed for antiretroviral treatment
	*	The child and care givers should be educated and motivated to give antiretroviral treatment.
	*	The child must be able to take full responsibility for the antiretroviral treatment.
6.	Which of the following is an essential part of preparing a family for antiretroviral treatment?
	*	The parents must have a good understanding of HIV.
	*	The whole family must know the child’s HIV status.
	*	The child’s weight should be increased to the 50th percentile.
	*	There should be running water and electricity in the home.
7.	How long does it usually take to prepare a family for antiretroviral treatment?
	*	Two months
	*	A months
	*	Three weeks
	*	Two weeks
8.	After starting antiretroviral treatment, when should you arrange the first follow-up visit?
	*	One week
	*	Two weeks
	*	Three weeks
	*	Four weeks
9.	What special blood test should be done at the second follow-up visit if the child is receiving nevirapine?
	*	Alanine transferase (ALT)
	*	A lipid profile
	*	Serum lactate concentration
	*	Blood glucose concentration
10.	What should the viral load be after six months of antiretroviral treatment?
	*	No higher and at least 10% below the baseline level
	*	At least 25% below the baseline level
	*	At least 50% below the baseline level
	*	Undetectable
11.	What is excellent adherence on twice a day dosage?
	*	Taking 50% of the required doses
	*	Taking 80–95% of doses
	*	Taking at least 95% of doses
	*	Not missing any doses
12.	What are the dangers of poor adherence?
	*	Severe side effects
	*	Drug resistance
	*	Treatment failure
	*	Both drug resistance and treatment failure
13.	How can adherence be improved?
	*	Using reminders such as an alarm clock or radio programme
	*	Threatening to stop antiretroviral treatment
	*	Severely criticising the parents at the follow-up clinic
	*	Giving the antiretroviral drugs as an intramuscular depot
14.	Excellent adherence must be assessed and stressed at:
	*	The first follow-up visit
	*	The second follow-up visit
	*	The six month follow-up visit
	*	Every follow-up visit
15.	Drug resistance may occur when:
	*	INH prophylaxis for TB interferes with the antiretroviral drugs.
	*	3 drugs are used instead of 4.	
	*	Nevirapine is used as prophylaxis during delivery.
	*	Steroids are given at the same time as antiretroviral treatment.
16.	Which antiretroviral drugs may interact with INH to cause peripheral neuropathy?
	*	Efavirenz and nevirapine
	*	d4T and ddI
	*	AZT
	*	Lopinavir/ritonavir
17.	What should be done if the first-line treatment fails in spite of excellent compliance?
	*	Increase the dose of the drugs.
	*	Add a fourth antiretroviral drug.
	*	Change to second-line treatment.
	*	Nothing more can be offered as treatment.
18.	What TB drug commonly interacts with antiretroviral treatment?
	*	Ethionamide
	*	Rifampicin
	*	Ethambutol
	*	Pyrazinamide
19.	What is the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)?
	*	One of the criteria for stage 4 HIV infection
	*	A common indication for starting antiretroviral treatment
	*	A serious side effect of nevirapine
	*	A possible reason for an unexpected deterioration after starting antiretroviral treatment
20.	What immunisation is typically associated with the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in children?
	*	Polio
	*	Pertussis
	*	BCG
	*	Measles
