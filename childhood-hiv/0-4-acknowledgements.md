# Acknowledgements

The aim of this book is to promote and improve the care of all HIV-infected children, especially in under-resourced communities in southern Africa. The learning material is presented in a way to enable groups of healthcare workers to take responsibility for their own continuing training.

We wish to gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Ms Patti Apolles, Dr Minette Coetzee, Prof Mark Cotton, Dr Teresa Edwards, Dr Beth Harley, Dr Steve Innes, Dr Karen Jennings, Dr James Nuttall, Ms Collette Mansfield, Dr Tammy Meyers and Prof David Power. When opinions differed between contributing colleagues, the simplest, most practical choice was adopted. While every effort has been made to correct any errors in the text, the final decision and responsibility was ours alone.

Reference sources include the *Handbook of Paediatric AIDS in Africa* by the African Network for the Care of Children Affected by AIDS. Where possible, we attempted to comply with World Health Organisation, South African national and provincial, and Red Cross War Memorial Childrenâ€™s Hospital HIV prevention, diagnostic and management protocols.

Our sincere thanks go to the publishers for their willingness to support this project and for their innovative vision of presenting the text in both book and web-based format. The question-and-answer layout is adapted from that of the highly successful Perinatal Education Programme.

Royalties from the sale of this book will go to Eduhealthcare, a not-for-profit organisation, which has the goal of improving the healthcare of children, especially in poor countries, through the education of nurses and doctors. We thank Eduhealthcare for generously funding this project.

*Professor David Woods and Professor Brian Eley*
