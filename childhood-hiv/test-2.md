# Test 2: Clinical and immunological diagnosis of HIV infection

1.	During the first six weeks after HIV infection:
	*	The child always becomes seriously ill.
	*	The CD4 count rises.
	*	The amount of HIV in the blood increases.
	*	The haemoglobin concentration falls.
2.	Acute seroconversion illness usually presents with:
	*	A glandular fever-type illness
	*	Jaundice
	*	Anaemia
	*	Vaginal or urethral discharge
3.	How long is the latent phase of HIV infection in children who are infected at birth?
	*	10 days
	*	6 weeks
	*	About three to six months
	*	Usually five to 10 years
4.	What is the value of knowing the clinical stage of HIV infection?
	*	The clinical stage predicts what the prognosis will be, especially without antiretroviral treatment.
	*	It helps to diagnose symptomatic HIV infection at birth.
	*	Antiretroviral treatment is not useful in stage 3 and 4 HIV disease.
	*	It is of very little clinical help.
5.	When is HIV infection called advanced HIV disease in children?
	*	At any stage of symptomatic HIV infection.
	*	If the clinical stage is 3 or 4.
	*	If the CD4 percentage is below 20.
	*	If the viral load is above one million copies/ml.
6.	Which clinical sign is common in stage one HIV infection?
	*	Night sweats
	*	Fever
	*	Persistent generalised lymphadenopathy
	*	Weight loss
7.	Which clinical condition is common in stage 2 HIV infection?
	*	Skin rash
	*	Severe diarrhoea
	*	Extrapulmonary tuberculosis
	*	Oral candidiasis (thrush)
8.	A common clinical condition in stage 3 HIV infection is:
	*	Severe recurrent bacterial pneumonia
	*	Pneumocystis pneumonia
	*	Enlarged parotid glands
	*	Hydrocephaly
9.	What clinical condition indicates that an HIV-positive child has stage 4 disease?
	*	Oral candidiasis
	*	Oesophageal candidiasis
	*	Diarrhoea for less than two weeks
	*	Persistent fever
10.	Unexplained severe malnutrition with wasting that does not respond to feeding indicates that the HIV infection has reached what clinical stage?
	*	Stage 1
	*	Stage 2
	*	Stage 3
	*	Stage 4
11.	What skin rash is common in children with HIV infection?
	*	Acne
	*	Urticaria
	*	Kaposi’s sarcoma
	*	Pruritic papular eruption
12.	What form of cancer is more common in children with HIV infection?
	*	Cervical cancer
	*	Leukaemia
	*	Lymphoma
	*	Neuroblastoma
13.	What test is used to screen children older than 18 months for HIV infection?
	*	VDRL test
	*	PCR test
	*	HIV culture
	*	Rapid test
14.	How long should you wait after stopping breastfeeding a nine-month-old child before doing an ultrasensitive p24 antigen test to diagnose or exclude HIV infection?
	*	72 hours
	*	One week
	*	Six weeks
	*	18 months
15.	Which test can confirm that a six-week-old infant has HIV infection?
	*	PCR test
	*	Rapid test
	*	ELISA test
	*	CD4 test
16.	Screening tests for HIV infection usually become positive when the person has been infected for:
	*	Six days
	*	Six weeks
	*	Six months
	*	Six years
17.	What is the normal CD4 percentage in children?
	*	Below 10%
	*	10 to 25%
	*	25% or more
	*	100%
18.	During the progression of untreated HIV infection the CD4 count:
	*	Rises
	*	Falls
	*	Stays the same
	*	Is not important
19.	What is the value of knowing the CD4 percentage?
	*	The lower the CD4% the greater the risk of severe illness.
	*	The higher the CD4% the greater the risk of death.
	*	A low CD4% indicates that the child’s immune system is improving.
	*	A normal CD4% indicates that the child does not have HIV infection.
20.	In South Africa, who can give consent for a child to be tested for HIV?
	*	The consent of both parents is always needed.
	*	The consent of the medical superintendent is always needed.
	*	A child of 12 years or older can give consent.
	*	Any child attending school can give consent.
