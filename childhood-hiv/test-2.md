	+	About three to six months
	-	Usually five to 10 years
4.	What is the value of knowing the clinical stage of HIV infection?

	-	At any stage of symptomatic HIV infection.
	+	If the clinical stage is 3 or 4.
	-	If the CD4 percentage is below 20.
	-	If the viral load is above one million copies/ml.
6.	Which clinical sign is common in stage one HIV infection?

	-	Fever
	+	Persistent generalised lymphadenopathy
	-	Weight loss
7.	Which clinical condition is common in stage 2 HIV infection?

	-	Oral candidiasis (thrush)
8.	A common clinical condition in stage 3 HIV infection is:
	+	Severe recurrent bacterial pneumonia
	-	Pneumocystis pneumonia
	-	Enlarged parotid glands
	-	Hydrocephaly
9.	What clinical condition indicates that an HIV-positive child has stage 4 disease?
	-	Oral candidiasis
	+	Oesophageal candidiasis
	-	Diarrhoea for less than two weeks
	-	Persistent fever
10.	Unexplained severe malnutrition with wasting that does not respond to feeding indicates that the HIV infection has reached what clinical stage?
	-	Stage 1
	-	Stage 2
	-	Stage 3
	+	Stage 4

	-	Leukaemia
	+	Lymphoma
	-	Neuroblastoma
13.	What test is used to screen children older than 18 months for HIV infection?
	-	VDRL test
	-	PCR test
	-	HIV culture
	+	Rapid test
14.	How long should you wait after stopping breastfeeding a nine-month-old child before doing an HIV PCR test to diagnose or exclude HIV infection?
	-	72 hours
	-	One week
	+	Six weeks
	-	18 months
15.	Which test can confirm that a six-week-old infant has HIV infection?
	+	PCR test
	-	Rapid test
	-	ELISA test
	-	CD4 test
16.	Viral tests for HIV infection usually become positive when the person has been infected for:
	-	Six days
	+	Less than six weeks
	-	Six months
	-	Six years
17.	What is the normal CD4 percentage in children?
	-	Below 10%
	-	10 to 25%
	+	25% or more
	-	100%
18.	During the progression of untreated HIV infection the CD4 count:
	-	Rises
	+	Falls
	-	Stays the same
	-	Is not important
19.	What is the value of knowing the CD4 percentage?
	+	The lower the CD4% the greater the risk of severe illness.
	-	The higher the CD4% the greater the risk of death.
	-	A low CD4% indicates that the child’s immune system is improving.
	-	A normal CD4% indicates that the child does not have HIV infection.
20.	In South Africa, who can give consent for a child to be tested for HIV?
	-	The consent of both parents is always needed.
