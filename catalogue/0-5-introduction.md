## About the Bettercare series

Bettercare publishes an innovative series of distance-learning books for healthcare professionals, developed by the Perinatal Education Trust, Eduhealthcare, the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, the Desmond Tutu TB Centre, the Perinatal Mental Health Project, the Academic Unit for Infection Prevention and Control at Stellenbosch University, and the Infection Control Africa Network, with contributions from numerous experts.

Our aim is to provide appropriate, affordable and up-to-date learning material for healthcare workers in under-resourced areas, so that they can learn, practise and deliver excellent patient care.

The Bettercare series is built on the experience of the Perinatal Education Programme (PEP), which has provided learning opportunities to over 60&nbsp;000 nurses and doctors in South Africa since 1992. Many of the educational methods developed by PEP are now being adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

## Why decentralised learning? 

Continuing education for health workers traditionally consists of courses and workshops run by formal trainers at large central hospitals. These courses are expensive to attend, often far away from the health workers’ families and places of work, and the content frequently fails to address the biggest healthcare challenges of poor, rural communities.

To help solve these many problems, a self-help decentralised learning method has been developed which addresses the needs of professional healthcare workers, especially those in under-resourced regions.

## Books in the Bettercare series

### Adult HIV

*Adult HIV* covers an introduction to HIV infection, management of HIV-infected adults at primary-care clinics, preparing patients for antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, ARV drugs, starting and maintaining patients on ARV treatment and an approach to opportunistic infections. *Adult HIV* was developed by doctors and nurses with wide experience in the care of adults with HIV, in collaboration with the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation.

*Well Women* was written for primary health workers who manage the everyday health needs of women. It covers reproductive health, family planning and infertility, common genital infections, vaginal bleeding, and the abuse of women.

## Format of the courses

### Objectives

The learning objectives are clearly stated at the start of each chapter. They help the participant to identify and understand the important lessons to be learned.

### Pre- and post-tests

There is a multiple-choice test of 20 questions for each chapter at the end of the book. Participants are encouraged to take a pre-test before starting each chapter to benchmark their current knowledge, and a post-test after each chapter to assess what they have learned. Self-assessment allows participants to monitor their own progress through the course.

### Question-and-answer format

Theoretical knowledge is presented in a question-and-answer format, which encourages the learner to actively participate in the learning process. In this way, the participant is led step by step through the definitions, causes, diagnosis, prevention, dangers and management of a particular problem.

Participants should cover the answer for a few minutes with a piece of paper while thinking about the correct reply to each question. This method helps learning. 

Simplified flow diagrams are also used, where necessary, to indicate the correct approach to diagnosing or managing a particular problem. 

Each question is identified with the number of the chapter, followed by the number of the question, for example 5-23.

> Important practical lessons are emphasised like this.

Note
:	Additional, non-essential information is provided for interest and given in notes like this. These facts are not used in the case studies or included in the multiple-choice questions.

### Case studies

Each chapter closes with a few case studies which encourage the participant to consolidate and apply what was learned earlier in the chapter. These studies give the participant an opportunity to see the problem as it usually presents itself in the clinic or hospital. The participant should attempt to answer each question in the case study before reading the correct answer. Case studies without the correct answers are also used at the start of some chapters to identify common clinical problems that need to be addressed.

### Practical skills

Some Bettercare books include chapters on practical skills that need to be practised, preferably in groups. These skills chapters list essential equipment and present step-by-step instructions on how to perform each task, often with pictures. If participants are not familiar with a practical skill, they should ask an appropriate medical or nursing colleague to demonstrate the clinical skill to them. In this way, senior personnel are encouraged to share their skills with their colleagues.

### Final examination

On completion of each course, participants can take a 75-question, self-managed multiple-choice examination.

All the exam questions will be taken from the multiple-choice tests from the book. The content of the skills chapters will not be included in the examination.

Participants need to achieve at least 80% in the examination in order to successfully complete the course. Successful candidates will be sent a certificate which states that they have successfully completed that course. South African doctors can earn CPD points on the successful completion of the CPD test at the end of each chapter.
